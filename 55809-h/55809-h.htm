<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>It required long trains of complex circumstances,
and peculiar conditions for each, to give
to the world a Moses, an Alexander, a Napoleon,
a Washington. Still greater were the pre-arrangements
and preparations for the development of
the coming man of the Nineteenth Century, that
he might stand pre-eminently upon the summit
of American manhood. The habitation selected
was the most elaborate and lovely of all the gifts
of nature: A domain dedicated to freedom forever,
bountifully supplied with animals, vegetables,
and minerals; with lakes, rivers, and
running brooks, grassy lawns and fields of flowers;
making a fitting place for the best blood left
of the American Revolution; descendants of
Anglo-Saxon kings; knights of Norman titles
and heroic deeds; supporters of William the Conqueror,
whose ancestral names appear in the
Doomsday Book, but more imperishably written
in the law of descent and transmission. With
such the new environment brought forth an improved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
species, christened by a sovereign state,
“<cite>The Squirrel Hunters of Ohio; or, Glimpses of
Pioneer Life</cite>,” and to whom this volume is most
respectfully dedicated.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>As an actor and interested witness of the marvelous
changes which have occurred in the settlement
and civilization of the “North-west Territory,”
the author places before the reader this
book, entitled, “<cite>The Squirrel Hunters of Ohio; or,
Glimpses of Pioneer Life</cite>.”</p>

<p>Others have faithfully recorded the wars, bloodshed,
victories, defeats, dangers and deaths it
cost to subjugate the savage and establish the
civilized. And it is as the gleaner follows the
reapers and gathers in the wayward straws, that
the author hopes to interest and entertain, by
picking up some of the fragments, that nothing
may be lost which contributed to the elevation,
pleasure, subsistence and safety of the pioneer,
or added attractiveness to his home during the
rise of the first state in the great empire of the
North-west.</p>

<p>It is often the little things that become the most
important&mdash;things the immigrant in old age delights
to recall&mdash;things that bring up associations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and pleasures of former days&mdash;“the good old
times,” when with dog and gun the pioneer
walked the unbroken forest and made himself familiar
with the alphabet of beasts, birds and
trees.</p>

<p>At the close of the Revolution, the Eastern
States were old and prematurely gray, and
poverty, bankruptcy and starvation induced the
patriotic soldiers to accept pay for their services
in unsurveyed wild land in the “North-west Territory.”
The new acquisition was lauded as a
country flowing with equivalents to “milk and
honey,” and would sustain a large population,
make delightful homes, and furnish an easily-acquired
subsistence.</p>

<p>As soon as the Indian dangers were no longer
detrimental, the homeless poor, with guns, ammunition
and land certificates, flocked in from
all quarters of the world, took possession of the
country, and became the progenitors of a great
and pre-eminent people&mdash;“<em>The Squirrel Hunters of
Ohio</em>.”</p>

<p>From the time the Mayflower landed at Fort
Harmar (Marietta) in 1788 until 1795, emigration
had not materially increased the population of the
North-west, owing to the unstable and dissatisfied
condition of the Indians.</p>

<p>All this time, the soldier, who had served his
time in the cause of independence and been honorably
discharged without pay:&mdash;the poverty-stricken
patriot, unable to procure subsistence for
himself and family in the bankrupt colonies, had
been listening to accounts of a land “flowing with
milk and honey,” and was anxious to get there.
It was described as a country “fertile as heart
could wish:”&mdash;“fair to look upon, and fragrant
with the thousand fresh odors of the woods in
early spring.” The long cool aisles leading
away into mazes of vernal green where the swift
deer bounded by unmolested and as yet unscared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
by the sound of the woodman’s ax or the sharp
ring of the rifle. “He could imagine the wooded
slopes and the tall grass of the plain jeweled with
strange and brilliant flowers;” but there the
redman had his field of corn, and would defend
his rights.</p>

<p>The success of General Wayne in procuring
terms of peace with the warlike tribes of Indians
in the spring of 1795, caused such an influx of
emigration into the Ohio division of the North-west
Territory, that in 1798 the population enabled
the election of an Assembly which met the
following year, and sent William Henry Harrison
as a delegate to Congress. So rapidly did the
country fill up with new settlements that the
prospective state at the beginning of the nineteenth
century was knocking at the door for admission,
with all the pathways crowded by pedestrians&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;dogs and
guns; crossing the perilous mountains to reach a
country where a home was a matter of choice,
and subsistence furnished without money or
price.</p>

<p>Where all these lovers of freedom and free soil
came from, and how they got here, will ever remain
a mystery next in obscurity to that of the
Ancient Mound Builders. They brought with
them the peculiarities of every civilized nation,
and continued to come until Ohio became the
beaten road to western homes beyond. They
were God’s homeless poor&mdash;the file of a successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
revolution&mdash;the founders of a republic. As
such they accepted pay and bounty in wild
lands&mdash;established homes of civilization, cultivated
the arts and sciences, and soon increased
in numbers, until they became a people powerful
in war and influential in peace.</p>

<p>Men and women, the chosen best, of the entire
world, by causes foreordained, were made the exponents
of the axioms contained in the charter
founding the great empire of freedom. They
were strangers to luxury&mdash;unknown to the corroding
influences of avarice, and unfamiliar with
national vices. Their lives were surrounded with
happiness, and they lived to a good old age, enjoying
the pleasures of large families of children
in a land of peace and plenty. These and their
descendants are the “Squirrel Hunters” of history.</p>

<p>Kentucky had received her baptism into the
Union in 1791, but afterward felt slighted and
dissatisfied, looking toward secession, if the five
proposed states, outlined by the act of 1787 as
the North-west Territory, should constitute an
independent confederacy. The opinion seemed
to exist to no small extent, that the North-west
was by necessity bound to become separated from
the Atlantic States; and Kentucky was lending
her influence to this end. Josiah Espy, in his
“Tour in Ohio and Indiana in 1805,” says: “In
traveling through this immense and beautiful
country, one idea, mingled with melancholy emotions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
almost continually presented itself to my
mind, which was this: that before many years
the people of that great tract of country would
separate themselves from the Atlantic States, and
establish an independent empire. The peculiar
situation of the country, and the nature of the
men, will gradually lead to this crisis; but what
will be the proximate cause producing this great
effect is yet in the womb of time. Perhaps some
of us may live to see it. When the inhabitants
of that immense territory will themselves independent,
force from the Atlantic States to restrain
them would be madness and folly. It can
not be prevented.”</p>

<p>But the inhabitants of this immense territory
had a better and clearer vision of the mission of
this “vast empire;” it was to be the heart and
controlling center of a great nation of freemen.
And when Ohio, in 1803, entered the Union under
the enabling act, binding the Government to
construct a national highway from Cumberland
to the Ohio river, and through the State of Ohio,
as a bond of union between the East and West,
no more was heard of secession until the rebellion
of the sixties.</p>

<p>In 1821, a member of the Virginia legislature
(Mr. Blackburn), in discussing the question of
secession, claimed there ought to be an eleventh
commandment, and taking a political view of it,
said it should be in these words: “Thou shalt
not, nor shall thy wife, thy son or thy daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
thy man-servant or thy maid-servant, the stranger
or sojourner within thy gates, dare in any wise
to mention or hint at dissolution of the Union.”
Mr. Blackburn did not live to see it, but the
words of the commandment came sealed in blood
and “were graven with an iron pen and lead in
the rock forever.”</p>

<p>Many persons at the very dawn of independence
felt the weakness of a union of such conflicting
sentiments and interests as those of freedom
and slavery, and were free in the expression
that either slavery or freedom must rule and control
the destinies of the nation&mdash;that the two
could not, nor would not, co-operate peaceably in
the same field.</p>

<p>Francis A. Walker, in “Making of the Nation,”
says: “No one can rightly read the history of
the United States who does not recognize the
prodigious influence exerted in the direction of
unreserving nationality by the growth of great
communities beyond the mountains and their
successive admission as states of the Union.”
And the author apprehends “<em>great danger</em>” from
the aversion of Western people to “measures proposed
in the interests of financial integrity, commercial
credit and national honor. ‘Having a
predilection for loose laws regarding bankruptcies
and cheap money has been a constant menace
and a frequent cause of mischief.’ This,
however, we may regard as due to the stage of
settlement and civilization reached.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>No one, if he reads at all, can read otherwise
than the “prodigious influence” of the Western
States. To these the nation owes its freedom.
Through this prodigious influence, slaves and
slavery have been wiped out, national finance established
with enlarged commercial credit, integrity
and national honor. And if the history of
the United States is correctly read, the country
need fear no <em>danger</em> from any <em>stage</em> in the settlement
and civilization of the North-west. The
early pioneers of this lovely country brought with
them from the South and East large stocks of
patriotism perfumed with the firearms of a successful
revolution; and it was prized more highly
as it was chiefly all they had in a home where
poverty was no disgrace, and a “poor-house” unknown
in nature’s great empire. Their descendants
inherited much, and increased their talents,
and have under all circumstances been ready to
render a favorable account and go up higher.</p>

<p>The residence of the immigrant was exceedingly
primitive; still, it could not be said the log
cabin of the pioneer made a cheerless home, by
any means. Man retains too much of the unevolutionized
not to find and enjoy the most
pleasure in things nearest the heart of nature.
Many pointers and pen pictures originating in
these humble domiciles exist in evidence of the
pleasure and satisfaction enjoyed by the early inhabitants,
regardless of apparent privations,
previous conditions or existing numbers.</p>

<p>Late in the fall of 1798 a revolutionary soldier
wrote on the fly-leaf of his Bible that the “North-west
Territory” made a delightful home, saying:
“My footsteps always gladly hasten homeward;
and when I pull the string and open the door,
the delicious odor of roasting game and cornbread
meets with smiles of hungry approbation.
And with kisses for the children and blessings
for a good wife, who could ask for more or a better
home.”</p>

<p>Another in 1799&mdash;“We often talk of fathers
and mothers, brothers and sisters and friends left
behind, and wish them <em>here</em>. And as the holidays
draw near we send them our wishes and
prayers, for it is all we can do. There is no mail
or carrier pigeon to cross the wilderness that
takes any thing else.”</p>

<p>The pioneer believed in the declaration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Ordinance of 1787, that “<em>Religion</em>, <em>Morality</em>, and
<em>Knowledge</em>” were necessary to good government
and happiness of mankind. Thanksgiving and
Christmas were days of universal observation.
The Star of Bethlehem was the Star of Empire,
and rested as brightly over the North-west
Territory as when shining on the little town in
Judea.</p>

<p>During the first few years of pioneer life, new
and interesting as it must have been, few persons,
comparatively, kept a diary of social life
and times; and of such accounts fewer still remain
to the present. Yet the number is sufficient
to show corroborating testimony or agreement
with the following in substance taken from
a family history of a father and mother who,
with three small children, a dog and gun, and
all their worldly goods, crossed the mountains on
foot, by following the Indian trail&mdash;reaching the
Ohio river, floated to the mouth of the Scioto on
a temporary raft, and from the confluence pushed
up its winding course over fifty miles in a “<em>dugout</em>”
to the “High Bank Prairie,” near where
Chillicothe now stands&mdash;making the trip from
Eastern Pennsylvania in sixty-three days; arriving
at the place of destination April 25, 1798&mdash;a
day of thanksgiving ever after.</p>

<p>The first Christmas seen or enjoyed in the new
home of this family would in the present era be
considered out of date, but doubtless at the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was the duplicate of hundreds of others. The
day, before the event, was set aside for procuring
extra supplies from nature’s store-house, regardless
of any signal service. A coon-skin cap
and gloves&mdash;deer-skin breeches and leggins, and
a wolf-skin “<em>hunting shirt</em>” made the weather
right at all times with the hunter.</p>

<p>Early in the morning on the 24th of December,
1798, this pioneer started out with dog and
gun in pursuit of Christmas supplies. It was
no small game day&mdash;a deer, moose, bear, or wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
turkey must adorn the bill of fare for the Christmas
dinner.</p>

<p>Before the sun had reached the meridian mark
in the door-way, he returned loaded down with
three turkeys and two grouse. The country
made such a favorable impression, as soon as
time and chance offered an opportunity, the husband
sent a letter to a friend at Redstone, Penn.,
who had never seen Ohio, in which he recalls
this hunt and the first Christmas he enjoyed in
this lovely country, and which is here given in
his own language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“After dressing the game and making a present
of a turkey and two grouse to a widow and
two children across the river, I told Grace (my
wife) that the man who got injured by the falling
tree must have a turkey, and with her approbation
I shouldered a dressed gobbler and delivered
the kind remembrances of my wife to the unfortunate.</p>

<p>“When I returned, it was quite dark, but my
mind was ill at ease, and I told Grace I thought
we had better take the other turkey down to
Rev. Dixon as he hunted but seldom, and a bird
of the kind would appear quite becoming, in the
presence of a large family of small children at a
Christmas dinner. These suggestions met with
hearty approval, and I started off to walk a half
mile or more with a great dressed gobbler in one
hand, a gun in the other, and dog in front.</p>

<p>“On arrival I found the latch-string drawn in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
but a knock on the door soon caused an opening
large enough to admit the procession. The presentation
was made with an Irish speech, dilating
and describing the virtues of the deceased;
and wishing the minister, his Quaker Mission and
his family a merry Christmas, I turned my steps
homewards.</p>

<p>“On my return, Grace wished to know what I
expected for our own dinner;&mdash;reminding me of
the guests,&mdash;Samuel Wilkins and Benjamin
James, who were looked for by invitation, I told
her I had been thinking while on the way home
from Mr. Dixon’s, that Dr. Hamberger and wife
up at the ferry were nice folks, and the Dr. had
been pretty busy in his ‘clearing’ lately, and that
Jack and I would go, early in the morning, up
to the beech bottom, and get a turkey for the
Doctor, and one for us&mdash;I said ‘<em>Won’t we Jack</em>’&mdash;and
Jack’s assent was at once made known by
the wag of his tail.</p>

<p>“Christmas morning, before the breakfast hour,
Jack and I returned with two gobblers, and
throwing them down at the cabin door I exclaimed
‘they are heavy.’ As I did so ‘<em>a merry
Christmas</em>’ from Grace rang out on the bare and
frosty forest for the first time ever heard in that
vicinity. ‘Oh! the poor birds’ (said Grace),
‘how nicely bronzed they are&mdash;who is it that
paints those iridescent colors? I never saw a
happier pair than you and Jack make.’ I replied,
‘they are beautiful birds, but if I’d had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
my wits about me, I could have shown the best
woman west of the Alleghanies the nicest fat
fawn she ever looked at. But I was hunting
for turkeys, and did not see it quite soon enough,
and let it go without a shot. Never mind,’ I
said, ‘I’ll be there in a day or two’&mdash;and I was.”</p></blockquote>

<div id="Ref_12" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" width="600" height="424" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The hunter states that he dressed the game,
left a turkey in the doctor’s cabin, and then assisted
Grace in placing a twenty pound bird on a
wooden spit to roast for dinner.</p>

<p>Before noon the invited guests came and after
pleasantly reviewing army scenes and political,
social and literary prospects of the people coming
to the unbroken wilderness of the North-west,
dinner was announced from the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
dining-room and parlor; and a more intellectual
and jolly company has probably not assembled at
a Christmas dinner since 1798. The guests had
filled important positions in the general government,
and were both natives of New York; while
the host was from Dublin, and hostess an English
lady, a former resident of London&mdash;all educated
people, and knew how to entertain and
partake of social and mental enjoyments.</p>

<p>The good pioneer became schooled to a quiet,
but heroic submission to the unavoidable; and
in this virtue Grace was recognized a model
throughout the settlement. Still she manifested
the greatest sorrow one could well express in the
loss of the souvenir she had so carefully preserved
and protected from damage during the long and
perilous journey to Ohio. A large English Bible,
printed in the infancy of the art, containing the
family coat of arms and record for over four hundred
years, with a chart of unbroken line of descent
for near one thousand years. All was lost
in the burning of their cabin in 1812.</p>

<p>The pioneer and his good wife lived to enjoy
with these three children and grandchildren,
forty-six returns of the Star of Bethlehem, near
where the first Christmas day was seen in Ohio;
and the writer has often heard the aged couple
recite with feelings of delightful remembrance
the first Christmas in Ohio as the dearest and most
enchanting of all others.</p>

<p>A country by nature so lovely exerted no little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
influence on the civilization and character of its
early, but mixed inhabitants. They all were, or
soon became, genial, warm-hearted, kind, neighborly
and obliging, in a sense unknown to phases
of civilization connected with affluent circumstances.
They generally settled at short distances
from each other, to better enable them to render
mutual assistance, and also protection in times
of danger. Much of the labor necessary to open
up a new country of this character could not be
performed “weak-handed” as “rolling logs,”
building cabins, opening roads, etc.; and when
a new arrival appeared in the settlement and announced
his desire to remain, all the neighborhood
would cheerfully turn out, and with shovels, axes
and augurs assemble at some designated spot in
the forest, and work from day to day until a
domicile was completed. Although entirely gratuitous,
the construction of these log-houses was
a business of experience. First, trees were cut
down sufficiently to make an opening for sunlight,
and site to place the cabin; then logs of determined
diameter and length were cut and placed
in position, one above another, and by notching
the corners in a manner calculated to make them
lie closely together, the whole became very substantial
and binding. Cross-logs made sleepers
and joists, and similar logs of different lengths
formed the gables, and which were held together
by supports for the roof in a way truly primitive
and ingenious. It was covered with clap-boards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
four or five feet long, split from oak timber,
placing them in the usual way to turn rain,
and securing their position by a sufficient number
of heavy poles or split pieces of timber reaching
the length of the roof at right angles to the
boards. The weight pole at the eaves was made
stationary by the projecting ends of the top logs
at the corners of the building, and the others were
prevented from rolling down and off the building
by intervening blocks of wood placed parallel
with the clap-boards, one end resting against the
pole at the eaves and the other end acting as a
stop to the pole next above; and so on to the
comb of the roof. The floor, if not of earth, was
made of puncheons or long clap-boards. The
door was constructed of heavy pieces of split
timber, joined to the cross-sections, or battens
with wooden pins. One end of the lower and upper
battens was made to project far enough beyond
the side of the door, and large enough to admit an
auger hole of an inch and a half to form part of
the hinge for the door. The battens and hinges
were placed on the inside, also the latch, to which
a strong string was attached, and passed through
a small hole a short distance above, terminating
on the outside. By pulling the string the latch
was raised and the door opened by persons without.
At night, the string was pulled in, which
made a very secure and convenient fastening, in
connection with the two great wooden pins that
projected on the line of the top of the door to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
prevent it from being raised off the hinges when
closed. It is quite probable, as has often been
suggested, this primitive latch and lock combination
gave rise to the saying “you will find the
latch-string always out.”</p>

<p>There were no windows; but, if one was attempted,
it consisted of a small opening without
frame, sash, or glass, and was covered with a
piece of an old garment or greased paper. The
chimney formed the most important, as well as
singular, part of the structure. It was built
upon the outside, and joined to the cabin some
five or six feet in height at the base, and then
contracted, forming a stem detached from the
building and terminating short of its height.
The materials used in its construction consisted
of sticks and mud, and when completed resembled
somewhat in shape an immense bay window,
or an overgrown parasite. The logs of the building
were cut away at the chimney so as to give a
great opening into this mud pen for a fireplace,
and which sometimes had a back-wall made of
clay, shale, or stone. The crevices between the
logs were filled with small pieces of split wood
and clay mortar, both on the inside and outside.
Numerous augur holes were bored in the logs,
and pins driven in to hang articles of apparel
and cooking utensils on. Two pins in particular
were always so arranged as to receive the gun,
and perhaps under which might be seen a pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of deer antlers to honor the powder-horn and
bullet pouch.</p>

<p>To erect a rude cabin of this kind would frequently
occupy all the persons in a neighborhood
three or four days; and, when finished, made a
very humble appearance in the midst of the natural
grandeur of its surroundings. Even after
the occupants were domiciliated, the addition of
their worldly goods added but little to the unostentatious
show of comfort. In the absence of
facilities for transportation, the pioneer was
obliged to leave most every thing behind; or,
worse perhaps, had nothing but family, dog, and
gun to bring with him; so the furniture of his
new home consisted of a bedstead made of poles&mdash;a
table from a split log;&mdash;a chair in the shape
of a three-legged stool;&mdash;a bench, and a short
shelf or two. The utensils for cooking were
quite as limited and simple, and corresponded in
usefulness and decoration most admirably with
the furniture; generally consisting of a kettle,
“skillet,” stew-pan, a few pewter dishes, and
gourds. These with an occasional souvenir, or
simple article that could be easily carried from
the “Old Home,” made up the invoice of the inside
of the cabin of the pioneer.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the apparent scanty comforts
in the house, they were more imaginary than
real. It required but little exertion to keep the
larder supplied with the choicest beasts, birds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and fish, which with hominy, or, still better, the
corn dodger, shortened with turkey fat or bear’s
oil, and baked in the ashes&mdash;or that climax, the
“johnny-cake” well browned and piping hot on
the board in front of a grand open fire&mdash;constituted
a substantial diet that might be envied by
those of the present day. In addition to these,
there was no lack of pumpkins, potatoes, turnips,
beans, berries,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> honey, and maple sugar, and the
early settler had little reason to sigh for the delicacies
of a more advanced civilization.</p>

<p>Sugar making was an attractive calling and
one of the pioneers’ money-making industries,
although sugar groves were scattered over the
entire state. The trees, by nature, were gregarious,
growing in clusters from hundreds to thousands
so thickly set over the ground that few if
any other varieties could find room to maintain
a standing. There are a few of the older crop
of sugar trees still remaining; but the great
“<em>camps</em>” that furnished sweets in abundance
have, with other varieties of timber, fallen victims
to the woodman’s ax.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the yearly “<em>tapping</em>”
might injure the growth and shorten the longevity
of the trees; but both experiment and
observation tend to sustain the opposite opinion.
A tree that has been under the notice of the writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
for more than seventy years, and has been tapped
in three to four places every year for the period
named, is still a beautiful, healthy, growing tree.</p>

<p>It may be correct, that “it takes more than
one swallow to make a summer;” but the evidence
shown in the wood made into lumber after
many years “<em>tapping</em>” for “<em>sugar water</em>” (not sap),
is not significant of injury or decay. The cut
made by the auger is soon closed over, which, no
doubt, would be different if the sugar was obtained
from “<em>the sap</em>” or wood-producing fluid.
The fluid which contains the sugar is no nearer
the “<em>sap</em>” (or blood of the tree) than is the milk,
or other cellular secretion of a gland, near or
identical with the blood or life sustaining and
constructive element of animal existence.</p>

<p>A pioneer who owned a small cluster of sugar
trees made his own sugar and some to spare,
while those working camps of several thousand
trees made it a “profitable calling and supplied
others at reasonable rates of exchange,” so no
one had occasion to stint or reason to complain.
It required some labor and expense to equip a
camp for making sugar; but once furnished, the
material lasted many years. During the time
unoccupied, the furnace and kettles under the
shed would be surrounded with a temporary
fence&mdash;the sugar-troughs, spiles, sled, water-barrel,
funnel-buckets, etc., at the ending of the
sugar season would be safely housed to remain
until the next year. As soon as the icy earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
began giving way to mild sunshining days in the
latter part of winter, it was considered by the
“<em>sugar-maker</em>” as the announcement of the near
approach of “<em>sugar weather</em>.” At such times, on
like indications, the “<em>sugar-troughs</em>” would be
taken from the place of deposit and distributed
to the trees; the better ones getting the larger
troughs. The water-barrel underwent inspection&mdash;the
funnel refitted&mdash;sled repaired&mdash;the
pile of dry wood increased&mdash;store-room or annex
renovated&mdash;tubs and buckets soaked&mdash;shortage
of “<em>spiles</em>” and “<em>sugar-troughs</em>” made good&mdash;furnace
and kettles cleaned, and every thing
made ready for the work.</p>

<p>After this, the first clear frosty morning with
the prospect of a thawing day, a man would be
seen with an auger passing rapidly from tree to
tree, closely followed by another, with a basket
and hatchet, who “<em>drove the spiles</em>” and set the
troughs as fast as the one with the auger made
the holes.</p>

<p>It would have astonished a Havemeyer<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to witness
the rapidity with which the “<em>tapping</em>” was
accomplished. In a few moments the surrounding
forest seemed sparkling with the beauties of
the rainbow, and echoing the music of falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
waters, each tree dripping, dripping with a
rapidity suggestive of a race and wager held by
Nature for the one that first filled the assigned
trough with sparkling gems.</p>

<p>A “<em>run</em>” of sugar-water was not dependent
upon a special act of Congress, nor was the product
a subject for public revenue. It was limited,
however, to frosty nights and warmer days; and
when a number of consecutive days and nights
remained above or below freezing, the “<em>sugar-water</em>”
would cease to flow, often making it
necessary to remove the “<em>spiles</em>” and freshen the
auger-hole at the next run to insure the natural
ability of the tree.</p>

<p>Sugar manufactured in those days was made
from the black maple or sugar tree. This tree
was very productive&mdash;in an ordinary season
would run ten or twelve gallons each in twenty-four
hours, and during the season average enough
for ten to fifteen pounds of sugar&mdash;the better
trees have been known to produce over fifty
pounds each in an ordinary season. This, however,
was before Congress suspected a trust and
combine would be a good thing for the common
people or got up the Luxow investigation and
whitewash of the sugar business by New York.
The sugar maker knows quite well the kind of
days he could obtain a run of “sugar-water,”
and for that purpose one or more holes were
bored into the tree three to five inches deep, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
“spiles” driven in to conduct the fluid into the
sugar-trough.</p>

<p>The “spiles” that conducted the water from
the tree to the trough were made from sections
of elder or sumac, eight or ten inches in length,
shaved down to the pith from three inches of one
end, which formed the shoulder, made tapering to
close the auger hole of the usual size, three-fourths
of an inch. The pith in the shoulder
and body of the spile was removed so as to form
a channel for the sugar-water to escape. The
sugar-trough was a short trough two to four feet
long made of some light wood, as the white walnut,
and were carefully charred on the inside or
concavity to prevent the injury of the delicate
flavor of the sugar. Many persons, familiar
with higher mathematics and languages named
in the curriculum of Yale or Harvard, as well as
words and phrases used in athletic games, and
manly arts of self-defense, would be turned down
if asked to describe or name the uses of many
very simple things to an Ohio “squirrel hunter”
of three score and ten years.</p>

<p>No doubt there are many more persons that
have seen and felt the great Congressional Sugar
Trust and Combine than are now living who have
seen the headquarters of one of those primitive
“<em>sugar camps</em>,” with its row of kettles placed over
a furnace&mdash;under an open shed&mdash;parallel with
and near the kettles under this shed, a reservoir
made from a section of a large tulip tree, to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the excess of gathered water during the day for
night boiling&mdash;the sled and mounted barrel with,
a sugar-trough funnel&mdash;the annex near the furnace
to obtain light and heat, with other primitive
articles or things connected with and used
in the manufacture of sugar.</p>

<p>The annex or temporary residence of those
running the camp was generally a strong well-built
cabin with one door, but no window. The
door occasionally showed a want of confidence
by being ornamented with a heavy padlock and
chain. This little building entertained many a
jolly crowd. It was the manufacturer’s office,
storeroom, parlor, bedroom and restaurant. It
was always a pleasant place to spend an evening,
and, still more, a delightfully-sweet place on “<em>stirring-off</em>”
days&mdash;to watch the golden bubbles burst
in air and with noisy efforts rising to escape,
driven back by their master with the enchantment
of a fat-meat pill and made to dance to
the tune of Yankee Doodle Dandy; for then
was the time to dip and cool the wooden “<em>paddle</em>,”
and taste again and again the charming sweetness
of maple sugar in its native purity.</p>

<p>But in less than a century sugar-trees, sugar-troughs,
and pioneer sugar making have been
classed with things of the past, scarcely known
by the many, and remembered but by a few;
and shows how soon time makes abandoned
words and many simple expressions of facts
obsolete and unknown. When it is said, “In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
infancy he was rocked in a sugar-trough,” the
language to many is as figurative, hypothetical
or meaningless as the “lullaby upon the tree
tops.” The younger generations never saw the
pioneer cradle, and Noah Webster did not get
far enough West to incorporate the word in his
“Revised Dictionary.”</p>

<p>The ordinary use of sugar-troughs was to catch
and hold the sweet water as it dripped from the
“<em>spile</em>” placed in the sugar-tree. But under
certain circumstances good specimens were devoted
to other purposes, and not a few eminent
lawyers, doctors, statesmen and divines have
proudly referred to their cradling days as those
having been well spent in the pioneer environment
of a “sugar-trough.”</p>

<p>The sugar made from trees was gradually
superseded by cane and beet productions; and
the supply has always remained equal to the
demand at moderate prices; and not until 1887
did the country discover the necessity of a
“Sugar Trust” to control and regulate the trade
of the United States. This combine started
with a capital of seven million dollars, capitalized
at fifty millions, and again was watered up
to seventy-five millions. This trust controlled
four-fifths to ninety-eight per cent of all the
refined sugar in the United States.</p>

of justice are not often evenly balanced in trust
monopolies that yield a net income of five hundred
per cent profit on the capital invested.</p>

<p>The pioneer, however, had no use for “combines”
to keep him poor, for like many facts not
admitted or recognized at the time, good subsistence
was so easily obtained from nature that it
frequently contributed much toward creating an
indifference for labor, which remained through
life and kept the man of destiny no better off
than when he arrived at his new home. It was
no easy task to clear the land and prepare the
soil for agricultural purposes. As a rule the
timber was large and thickly set upon the
ground; usually the best soil was covered with
the greatest trees, and the labor required for their
removal was not inviting to those who could
subsist well without it. The white oak, burr
oak, black oak, black walnut, sycamore, poplar,
and other varieties, had for centuries been adding
size and strength to their immense proportions.
These giants, and the smaller timber
and undergrowth, required great energy, perseverance
and protracted labor to remove and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
clear the ground ready for a crop. The usual
plan for their removal was by “girdling,” or
cutting a circle around the trunk of each sufficiently
deep to kill the tree, and then to burn by
piece-meals as the branches and trunks came
down by reason of time and decay. Consequently
the patch of sunshine around these
primitive homes, as a rule, did not enlarge very
rapidly, and the pioneer too often became a man
of procrastination and promise; and for all the
time he had (the present) preferred the dog and
gun to the maul and wedge as a means of subsistence.
Some, however, opened up small fields
and farms by disposing of the timber in this slow
way. In the meantime, while the process of
decay was going on, grain and vegetables were
grown in the openings among the dead timber.
The crops were generally divided pretty equally
between the wild animals and the landlord. This
loss, however, was of no great importance as
there was no money, market, or mill; nor
domestic animals to take a surplus. At a later
day, and after the introduction of “movable
mills,”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> there still existed no market for the products
of the soil, and to grow enough for food
seemed all that could be required of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ambitious pioneer; and if at any time the returns
exceeded the estimates and insured a surplus,
such overabundance seldom went to waste,
as there were always enough who yearly came
short in this respect, and were ready to share
with the more prosperous neighbor.</p>

<p>The time and labor expended upon clearing
the ground and raising grain met with little or
no reward. The products could not be sold nor
exchanged for necessaries of life. Consequently
the forests remained quite undisturbed for many
years and agriculture neglected, excepting for the
necessary consumption of the family. The early
settler, however, was not all the time free from
discouragements. His domestic animals frequently
became lost, or destroyed by ravenous
beasts; and diseases of the country occasionally
were protracted; and to the wife and children, he
sometimes felt, it was not so much a paradise.
But he came to stay, and this, for better or for
worse, was his home, and submitted philosophically
to circumstances and events he could not
control.</p>

<p>The wife and mother endured with patience
and heroism all privations and afflictions equally
with the husband and father, and performed the
arduous household duties; and, like the model
woman of old, “sought wool and flax and worked
willingly with her hands,” and the whirring
spinning-wheel and thudding loom were heard in
most every household. The welfare of the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
depended upon the success of home industries,
and consequently the wife had much less leisure
than the husband. She superintended the manufacture
of all the fabrics for the house and for
the clothing of the family, and cut and made up
the same without protection, tariff, rebate, or
combine. And it is singular so little has been
recorded of the good women who unlocked the
resources of the new territory and gave their aid
in founding a civilization that has surpassed all
precedents in the history of nations.</p>

<p>Natives of every country and of every grade of
intelligence in the new environment became alike
distinguished for liberality and hospitality&mdash;ever
desirous to forget the past, willing to admit the
future, and ready to enjoy the present, the life of
the pioneer was seldom darkened or overburdened
with toil or care, and had times of good cheer,
and was not without his social amusements. The
violin and Monongahela whisky found way to
the settlements and were accepted by many,
young and old; and the dance after a quilting,
shooting-match, fox-chase, bear-hunt, log-rolling,
or house-raising gave all the pleasure and excitement
desired.</p>

<p>As the population became more numerous,
leisure and the desire for amusements increased;
and among the many ways devised to entertain
and interest, no one, perhaps, ever received more
attention, higher cultivation, and obtained more
general favor than the chase. Most descendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of Virginia, however destitute in other respect,
had their packs of “hounds,” and the good people
and the better, the poor and the poorer, some on
horse and some on foot, mingled alike in the exciting
sport.</p>

<p>The pedigrees, qualities, and performances of
“lead dogs” of different owners were known over
the country, and their comparative merits were
frequently subjects that called forth the warmest
discussions, the disputants generally ending the
controversy with knock-down arguments on both
sides. The owners of the dogs always manifested
great pride and satisfaction in public praises and
good will toward their animals, and no offense
received a greater condemnation than the theft or
injury of one of these “noblemen’s pets.”</p>

<p>Whenever a “pack” failed in having a good
“leader” and “poked,” they lost their reputation
at once and forever. And many trips were made
on horseback through the wilderness over the
mountains to South Branch, or other points in
Virginia, on pretext of other business, when the
real purpose proved to be “fresh blood,” or perhaps
a pack of dogs that could take the front.
They were brought through on foot, chained one
behind another in double file, with a chain between,
and horse in front, resembling the transportation
of surplus of the “divine” institution
in the days of John Brown. New importations,
however, did not often give satisfaction. As a
rule, the dogs of the finest scent and greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
endurance and speed were bred in Ohio. Such
were McNeal’s “Nick,” Jordan’s “Sam,” Anderson’s
“Magnet,” Renick’s “Pluto the Swift,”
McDowell’s “Yelp,” Colonel Vause’s “Clynch,”
and a host of others that never saw a “bench-show,”
but were awarded the highest praises by
men who filled their places as well in the chase, as
many of them did, important public positions in
after life. And in the written history of these
notable contests for superiority is the circumstance,
if not the day, when Colonel Vause’s
little blue hound, his lead dog, “Clynch,” outwinded
and distanced all the other “packs” as
well as his own companions, and pursued the
deer alone so inveterately, the poor animal, confused
or to confuse, ran to the town of Chillicothe
and into the open, empty jail, and was there
captured.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Stray Pup.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But of all the dogs known to have taken part
in amusing the people of destiny;
or aided the advancing
strides of civilization, none
ever attracted such universal
attention, and enjoyed that
wide-spread fame as that given
to “<em>Gibbs’ Stray Pup</em>.”</p>

<p>Quite early in the fall, when as yet the frosts
had but slightly tinted the woodland foliage,
some hunters while after turkeys, saw a dog in hot
pursuit of a deer, and so close was the chase that
the fatigued animal leaped from a high bank into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
deep water in Paint Creek and expired immediately.
This dog proved to be a little half-starved,
lemon, black and white pup, not more than seven
months old, and having around his neck a section
of dilapidated bed cord. Such a performance by
a strange pup so very young and alone, attracted
no little attention and talk, especially among the
sporting gentlemen, who kept first-class dogs, and
doted more upon their hounds than upon their
lands and houses. Mr. James Gibbs was one of
these, and by right of discovery, took the pup in
charge and named him “Gamer.” The dog
proved a stray in the settlement, and no owner
could be found, and mere supposition gave a
satisfactory explanation. “The pup had broken
away from an emigrant wagon to get after the
deer.”</p>

<p>At maturity, true to instinct, Gamer refused to
follow deer, but became the embodiment of all
the virtues and qualifications of a thoroughbred
fox-hound. His fleetness, his extraordinary “<em>cold
nose</em>,” or ability to carry a “cold trail;” his industry,
perseverance, and sagacity, made him the
model and marvel of all who knew him. He
always led the pack far in advance, and so exact
was he to hound nature, that in case the fox
doubled short and came back near enough to be
seen and turned upon by all the other dogs, he
would continue around the course and unravel
every winding step. His voice was quite as marked
and remarkable as any of his other qualities: so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
much so, that for many years it lingered in the ears
of surviving friends like the far-off echo of an Alpine
horn. He could be distinctly heard across the
great valley, bounded east by the Rattlesnake and
west by Patton and Stone Monument Hills, a distance
of more than five miles in an air line. His
cry was musical, prolonged and varied, opening
with a deep loud bass, and closing with a high,
clear note, it would come to the listener sharp and
distinct, solitary and alone, when the united cry
of all the pack would be dead in the distance.</p>

<p>An accurate likeness with minute description of
this dog has been preserved&mdash;height, above the
average fox-hound; length, medium; head, long
and narrow and well elevated when running;
under jaw, three-fourths of an inch short, which
gave a pointed appearance to the face; eye, intellectual
and gamy, but of a most singular
yellow color; ears, long and thin, but not wide;
neck, slim and clean; shoulders, firm; chest,
deep, the breast-bone projecting so as to make a
perpendicular offset of two inches; back, quite
straight; loins, not wide; hind legs, unusually
straight; hams, thin, flat and tapering; tail,
slim, medium length, little curved, and hair short
towards the tip; color, white, excepting a large
black spot on each side of the chest, tipped with
lemon; a small black spot joined to a lemon spot
on each hip or root of the tail, lemon head and ears,
with small black spot behind each ear. Altogether
a fine appearing dog, especially when engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in the chase: and before two years old, was
held in high esteem by the owner.</p>

</div>

<p>The popularity of Gamer was now fast gaining
ground, as his performances were casting shadows
over dogs of
high repute, and
many things were
attempted to silence
the repeated
huzzahs that came
in at the end of
every chase for
“Gibb’s Stray
Pup.” Years
rolled on, pack
after pack, pick after pick were pitted against the
“pup” to no purpose excepting to widen the
difference by comparison.</p>

<p>A single incident taken from many that might
be given, will sufficiently illustrate the superior
qualities of this remarkable dog, as well as the
usual success attendant upon the efforts to detract
from his merited superiority by running
picked hounds with him in the chase. A number
of persons in every neighborhood kept hounds,
and each owner considered himself the possessor
of a small fortune, consisting at least of one
animal that was considered faster and truer than
any one belonging to a neighbor; and it was an
easy matter at any time to summon on short notice
fifteen to thirty of these favorites surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
by a conflict of good opinions. On the 11th of November,
18&mdash;, twenty gentlemen, some of whom
afterwards rose to high political and judicial
eminence in the history of the state and nation,
met by agreement and entered the forest at four
o’clock in the morning with twelve dogs, the pick
of the best packs known in the state. The atmosphere
was still, white frost hung on the trees
all day; the ground was but little frozen, and
other things perhaps conspired to make it favorable,
as hunters say, “for scent to lay.”</p>

<p>The dogs soon struck a cold trail, perhaps
where the fox had been the previous evening, and
which could be followed but slowly. Before midday,
it became too cold for all the dogs excepting
Gamer and two old hounds, one of which was famous
for his “cold nose.” The latter dogs, however,
were unable to get scent excepting in favorable
places; and, by three o’clock in the
afternoon, they too were out, and no longer able
to render assistance. Gamer still kept at work
trailing Reynard’s footsteps so closely, that on his
way he entered an old vacant cabin, declaring most
emphatically that Reynard had been there, showing
that even on the dry ground and probably
more than ten hours after the presence of the
animal, there was enough found to call forth a
most vigorous cry.</p>

<p>When more than half a mile from this cabin,
the trail was lost, and half an hour was consumed,
with all the dogs in circuits, to no purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
While engaged in these efforts to strike the track,
the wonderful “pup” raised his voice most significantly
at the very spot where he had ceased
his cry. He had discovered the track and commenced
a rapid backward march in the precise
line over the same ground he had passed but a
short time before. When within fifteen or twenty
rods of the old vacant cabin, he turned off
through a “deadening” in the direction of Mount
Logan, showing that, notwithstanding the fox
had retraced his steps for a long distance, the sagacious
hound detected the fact after going over
the ground, and that, too, when the trail was so
very cold that no other dog in the chase could
take the scent.</p>

<p>From Mount Logan the trail was leading
through thicker timber, and Reynard had been
zig-zagging here and there, in search, perhaps,
of birds and rodents for his supper the night before,
walking on logs and limbs of trees whenever
near his intended line of march. Here, the
dog quite knowingly changed his tactics, and for
two hours ran at more than half speed from log
to log, right to left, with nose close to the bark
and decayed wood, as he rapidly passed, would
let out his encouraging cry.</p>

<p>In this way he followed the crooked course
until the close of the day, carrying a trail for
thirteen hours, which the fox had passed at no
point less than ten hours before, following it,
too, more than three hours after the best and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
most renowned dogs ever in Ohio were silent.
It was now dusk, the timber sparse and logs few,
making the chances seemingly more unfavorable.
So, the hunters who had been on the go for fifteen
hours, and without the substantials of life for
twenty-four hours, concluded to quit, and, calling
the dogs to follow, turned in the direction of the
by-path leading toward home. All the dogs were
very ready to obey, excepting Gamer, who only
stopped for a moment to gaze at his retreating
masters, and then resumed his work, in which
he became more and more interested as the day
passed on. It was thought, however, he would
soon quit and overtake his companions but, before
the hunters had gone a mile, Gamer’s starting
cry was heard; he had winded Reynard
where he had stopped to spend the day high
up the mountain side. Every hound knew it
was no cry on a cold trail, and turned and went
off at the top of their speed. Soon Gamer could
be heard over ridges and hills far away; and the
hunters, thinking the run would be made in the
broken mountains, went home. A squirrel hunter
in that vicinity, who obtained Reynard’s “brush,”
reported the fox so closely pressed, that he soon
doubled, came back, and entered a hollow log
near his cabin, and was captured. The time
given showed the run was finished in less than
an hour after the hunters left.</p>

</div>

<p>The sense called “power of scent” is exceedingly
delicate in the dog, enabling him to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the course of one animal amid a multitude of
“tracks” made by others of the same species.
This power of discrimination is frequently manifest
even in the common house-dog as he traces
the footsteps of his master or those of his master’s
horse through crowded thoroughfares and
winding ways, although hundreds of similar feet
have passed over the ground after the walk of the
one he seeks was made. But, to tell any one but
an old foxhunter that it was possible to find perfection
in a dog sufficiently, under the most favorable
circumstances, to run all day on a trail ten
hours’ <em>cold</em>, would be deemed purely chimerical.&mdash;Gamer
is no more.&mdash;James Gibbs has long been
numbered with the dead.&mdash;And of those who participated
in and enjoyed the pleasures of that day’s
chase but one remains a living witness of the facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
herein stated&mdash;the old Roman&mdash;the Hon. Allen
G. Thurman.&mdash;It is a notable fact, that in after
years, when those Ohio boys no longer resembled
the festive <em>hunter</em>, they always gave a smile of
pleasure at the mention of those merry times;
and, even in old age, when oppressed with the
heavy hand of time, nothing awakened the flush
of youthful pride and satisfaction like the rehearsal
of the deeds of the hound that had no
equal in the history of the country&mdash;“<em>Gibbs’ Stray
Pup</em>.”</p>

<p>The exterior beauties of an animal are always
attractive. But more than these do we admire
those qualities termed intelligence, instinct, and
reason in their beneficent relations to man and
the external world. The dog possesses a most
wonderful harmony in form and faculties. He
is the type and embodiment of beauty, strength,
and freedom of motion combined with endurance,
courage, zeal, fidelity, constancy, and uncompromising
affection. For these reasons he is of all
man’s friends, the most valuable, the truest, and
the best. So devoted and unchangeable is his
love, that he is ever ready to sacrifice his life to
save his master from threatened injury. He
long remembers a kindness, and soon forgives ill
usage. At an early age he obtains a knowledge
of the meaning of words in the language of his
master, and understands and obeys commands;
and with that retentive memory which animals
possess, he never falters or forgets. The story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Ulysses and his favorite is but the citation of the
tenacity of memory which belongs to the species.
After twenty years&mdash;</p>

<p>From prince to beggar, all the same&mdash;the only
friend neither misfortune nor poverty can drive
away. He is watchful and bold, and with delight
guards his master’s house and herds from
thieves and rapacious animals, and by his various
services has accomplished for man’s happiness
and advancement in civilization <em>more than all
other agencies combined</em>. Without this aid, man
would scarcely have maintained his existence on
earth. “When he had ‘evolved’ to the ape,”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and “for safety lived in tree-tops with monkeys
and squirrels,” his security and advancement
was not so probably due to the suggestive “club”
as to <em>training</em> of dogs, which is given by the great
naturalist, Buffon, as the first art invented by
man.</p>

<p>By means of dogs, the rapacious animals common
to new or uninhabited countries are captured
or driven to the rear of advancing population.
Almost every emigrant in the earlier settlements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of Ohio, from necessity, became more
or less a hunter with dogs, not only to provide
for the family, but as a profit in ridding the
locality of thieving varments with which the
forests were overrun. The pelts of fur animals
were a legal tender, and were received as contributions
and payment of debts. And the bark
of the industrious dog was in this way transformed
into literary and religious institutions of
the country. And if not for his dogship, the
“North-west” would be a wilderness still, inhabited
by wild animals. The great naturalist
says: “To determine the importance of the
species in the order of nature, let us suppose it
never had existed.<a id="Ref_40"></a>” Without the assistance of the
dog, how could man be able to tame and reduce
other animals into slavery? How could he discover,
hunt, and destroy noxious and savage
beasts? To preserve his own safety, and to render
himself master of the animated world, it was
necessary to make friends among those animals
whom he found capable of attachment to oppose
them to others; therefore, the training of dogs
seems to have been the first art invented by man,
and the first fruit of that art was the conquest
and peaceable possession of the earth.</p>

<p>Many species of animals have greater agility,
swiftness, and strength, as well as greater courage
than man. Nature has furnished them
better. And the dog not only excels in these,
but also in the senses&mdash;hearing, seeing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
smelling; and to have gained possession over a
tractable and courageous species like the dog,
was acquiring new or additional agility, swiftness,
strength, and courage with a mysterious
increase of power and usefulness of the more important
senses. And by the friendship and superior
faculties of the dog, man became permanently
sovereign and master of all.</p>

<p>“The dog is the only animal whose talents are
evident, and whose education is always successful.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>No better picture, portraying the noble qualities
of the dog could be given than that by
Buffon. And why this close observer of nature
should say&mdash;“Without having like man <em>the faculty
of thought</em>,” has always seemed strange. It
sounds like a misprint, or an error in translation.
Thought is the exercise of the mind&mdash;reflection,
meditation, consideration, conception, conclusion,
judgment, design, purpose, intention, solicitude,
anxious care, concern, etc.</p>

<p>Who is there, even with ordinary acquaintance
with the animal, that has not witnessed
some if not all these attributes of “<em>thought</em>?” Most
writers on the subject have shown a desire to
give the human animal some distinguishing
quality or faculty above all others, but their line
of demarcation between man and the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
animal creation has not been altogether successful,
as man can not claim by the high authority
that he is the only species that has the
something called “<em>spirit</em>,” which is necessary in
order “<em>to think</em>;” for the sacred book teaches
that man and beast are alike in this, but the
<em>spirit</em> of man goeth upward, while the <em>spirit</em> of
the beast goeth downward to the earth, and
which in anti-bellum days constituted a knotty
text for Southern theologians who taught that
“<em>niggers and dogs</em>” have no souls.</p>

<p>An eminent Scotch clergyman, who has
made a study of natural history believes that
dogs are possessed of the same faculties as man,
differing only in degrees. He asserts that conscience
in man and conscience in the dog are essentially
the same things. And Charles Dickens
declares that dogs have a moral nature&mdash;an unmistakable
ability to distinguish between right
and wrong, which led him to believe the difference
in the dog nature and the so-called spiritual
nature in man was imperceptible, and that
future existence rested upon like natural foundations.</p>

<p>It would be holding conclusions in opposition to
all rules of observation to say that dogs and other
animals are destitute of the faculty of “<em>thought</em>.”
When the awful torrents came sweeping down
upon Johnstown the terrible waves and debris
dashed over housetops and Mrs. Kress was carried
away by the wild current in an instant beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
human help, her faithful dog, unmindful
of himself, jumped after her, and when he saw
her dress come to the surface, seized and carried
her to another housetop. Soon this house was
demolished, but Romeo kept the head of Mrs.
Kress out of water and battled with the raging
current and floating timber for more than half
an hour before he reached the roof of another
house, where she was taken up unconscious with
fright and exhaustion. When the dog saw the
motionless condition of his mistress he barked
and howled and made pitiful demonstrations of
grief, for he “<em>thought</em>” she was dead; but when
she breathed he became delighted and manifested
his joy in a way that could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>For eight summers a little cocker spaniel
(Archos) was daily with the writer in field and
forest, and to his industry and sagacity is due no
small part of the success in obtaining fresh
specimens for the life size, hand-colored work by
Mrs. N. E. Jones, entitled, “The Illustrations of
the Nests and Eggs of Birds of Ohio.” Many
of the rare small birds build on or near the
ground in thick cover, and among those he was
credited with finding may be mentioned the obscure
nest and eggs of the Helminthophaga
pinus&mdash;Blue-winged yellow warbler, and the
nest of the Geothlypistrichas&mdash;Maryland yellow-throat.
He knew the object of pursuit as well
as his master, and delighted in finding these little
homes, and would stand firmly on a point, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
it was understood between us that the bird must
be shot when flushed for positive identification.
He knew what his master was doing, for he understood
the meaning of almost all words used in
ordinary conversation, and could transact business
on orders with admirable accuracy.</p>

<p>While out with a friend quail shooting, the
sun was warm and we sat down on the cool grass
in a fence corner shaded by the dead leaves on
an oak bush. The little cocker was panting with
heat and enjoyed the shade quite as much as his
master. Soon a voice was heard from my friend,
on the opposite border of a large field, calling:
“Send Archos over here. I have a dead bird
my dog can’t find.” The cocker paid no attention
to the call, and no reply was made by the writer.
And to show how much a dog may acquire
of the meaning of words in a few years, I said
to Archos in a conversational tone, as he ceased
panting and fixed his great dark eyes on the
speaker: “Ed has lost a dead bird&mdash;he can not
find it; you go over and get it.” No sooner
said than the little fellow started off in the tall
ragweed which covered the field, and unknown
to my friend scented the dead bird and brought
it and laid it at my feet, all the time smiling and
wagging the tail, as much as to say, “I would
like to tell you how nicely that was done, but I
can’t talk&mdash;dare not.”</p>

<p>Bab says: “Away back in some old book there
is a story how dogs used to talk, and were men’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
advisers. One day a great prince met a beautiful
woman, and despite of the advice of the dog
who was his counselor, he married her, and he
made her cousin, a beggar, his prime minister.
Amid the festivities, the dog warned the prince
to watch the woman, told the prince that she was
unfaithful, that her cousin was her lover, and
that between them they would rob the kingdom
and drive him from the throne. He turned on
the dog and cursed him&mdash;cursed him so that this
good friend, looking at the prince, said: ‘Until
men are grateful and women are faithful, I and
my kind will never speak again.’”</p>

<p>The world has grown older and better, but for
the peace of society and quiet of social relations,
it’s well he still holds his tongue. Professor
Garner, who has devoted much time to the study
of animals in this country and in Africa, has confirmed
the general observation of those familiar
with rural life to be true: that cattle&mdash;as horses,
sheep, hogs and other animals&mdash;talk among their
kind. What there is to be detected in the manner
of delivery of the same sound, giving out
entirely different sensations, is yet to be discovered.
The squeal of the hungry pig, repeated
by the phonograph, only increases the hunger
and squeal of the pig that hears it; while to repeat
the similar squeal of a pig in pain, at once
causes manifest fear, anger and distress in all
the pigs that hear it. And it must be so&mdash;all domestic
animals do think and reason, and not unoften<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
are enabled to make their thoughts known
by signs and sounds to those to whom they look
for help and comfort other than their kind.</p>

<p>Dogs are utilized extensively in Germany and
other parts of Europe as draft animals. The
United States consul says, in the large, wealthy
and industrial city of Leige, and throughout Belgium,
dogs are used for delivery of goods by all
the trades of the city. While they are used as
hewers of wood and drawers of water, the species
is the most versatile in talents of the animal
creation&mdash;and the dog makes the most accurate
critic, the most successful detective, most reliable
witness, best sentinel and most trustworthy
friend.</p>

<p>Persons do not stop to think there is a world
of intelligence, love and affection outside the
human head and heart, and innocently ask,
“What makes the dog heed every word when
his master says ‘you can not go with me this
time?’ What makes him place himself at the
most observing point and look wistfully after his
departing friends until they disappear in the
distance? Why does he stay, perchance all
day, at a favorable point to hear or see a returning
approach, anxiously waiting and watching,
and at the well-known and accurately distinguished
sounds of the footsteps of his master’s
horse from all others, runs to meet his master,
and barks and laughs and cries with joy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
gladness?” The beneficence of creation gives
the answer in a world of unselfish love.</p>

<p>Dogs know nothing of hypocrisy&mdash;are always
sincere&mdash;never lie&mdash;dislike ridicule&mdash;and never accept
nor offer a joke.</p>

<p>The dog has been recognized as valuable property
by his owner in every age, nation and people
on the face of the earth; but with no staple
market price any more than there is for that of
the horse. The consideration is determined by
amount of education, usefulness or purposes
which he is capable of fulfilling.</p>

<p>Colonel D. D. Harris, of Mendon, Michigan,
refused more than once ten thousand dollars for
his famous sable <a id="Ref_47"></a>Scotch Collie. He was a dog
of such note, with the refined people of the
world, that he was privileged to walk through
the Vatican, and was entertained by the President
of France&mdash;the Czar of the Russias&mdash;the King
of Norway and Sweden, and other nobility of
the old world. President Cleveland stroked his
glossy coat, and he received the most grateful
attention among all the courts visited in this and
in other countries.</p>

<p>This Collie was never on public exhibition,
but was the traveling companion of his owner.
He could select any card called for in the deck&mdash;if
not there, would say so by giving a whine&mdash;could
distinguish colors as well as any human
being; and could count money and make change
with the rapidity and accuracy of an expert bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
accountant. If told to make change of $31.31,
or any other amounts from coins of various denominations,
he could do so rapidly and without
mistake. This intelligent dog lived out his allotted
brief existence, dying at the age of fourteen
years; but was better known than thousands
of men who have lived much longer,
thinking themselves quite eminent.</p>

<p>If dogs are not valuable property why are they
exchanged at high rates in dollars and cents?
Why did Mr. E. R. Sears, of Melrose, Mass.,
part with his twelve thousand five hundred dollars
in “greenbacks” for the dog Bedivere? It
may be <em>said</em> the one who purchased a dog at that
price was “<em>green</em>”&mdash;if said, it would be a mistake,
for <em>Green</em> was the gentleman who sold
him.</p>

<p>The greater part of the early population of
Ohio associated with dogs much of their time,
and with good results. But the law-makers of
the state, or a majority, had a penchant for self-elevation
by legislating against those they feared
as rivals&mdash;“dogs and niggers.” Consequently,
“Black laws” and dog laws engrossed the time
and talents of law-makers, who felt measurably
unsafe unless the former were excluded as property
and the latter deprived of citizenship.</p>

<p>The sensitive, if not infallible, Supreme Court
has recently given the property rights and protection
of the dog a bad set-back in the decision
that “dogs are not property,” and outside of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
property it would seem there can be no ownership.
But as decisions of the learned court are
not required to be accepted in silence by the
canine species, <em>this one</em> affecting their rights is
enough to make every dog of high and low degree,
from Maine to California, rise up with a
prodigious howl of contempt.</p>

<p>The logic by which the high court was enabled
to enunciate its decision is quite as remarkable
as the decision itself. It would seem the
learned court divided the animal creation into
two parts&mdash;“useful and useless,” and subdivided
these into “wild and domestic beasts;” and then
states: “Dogs belong to the non-useful, wild
animal division.” <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ergo</i>: “Wild animals, as dogs
which have been domesticated, are therefore
property <em>only while in actual custody</em>”&mdash;which
means in arms, cages, or confinement. An able
critic, and a very well-informed lawyer, says:
“Any respectable court would laugh at the proposition
that it is not theft to appropriate a diamond
which has escaped from the owner’s custody.”
But that is another kind of cow&mdash;<em>the
poor have dogs</em>, not <em>diamonds</em>. Still the learned
man is to be admired who said:</p>

<p>“I like dogs because I know so many men and
women.</p>

<p>“I like dogs because they always see my virtues
and ignore my vices.</p>

<p>“I like dogs because they are friends through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
good report and evil report&mdash;through poverty and
through riches.</p>

<p>“I like dogs because they are faithful and generous.</p>

<p>“I like dogs because they are full of simplicity
and find pleasure in very little things.”</p>

<p>The population of the early settlements of Ohio
bought and sold dogs, and considered them as
much property as horses, cattle, or other personalty.
They were not purchased by the pound;
neither were hogs nor cattle. Among traders of
the rural districts, every thing weighing over five
hundred pounds was bought and sold upon appearance
and opinion, by the piece.</p>

<p>Where the price caused a disagreement between
buyer and seller, some mutual friend, who
had obtained a good reputation as guesser, would
be called as an arbiter. Fattened cattle to go east,
purchased by “drovers,” were never weighed, but
were taken, like horses, at a given sum per head.
Fattened hogs, however, were generally weighed,
by request of the purchaser. Each hog would be
suspended, and weight determined by the “steelyard,”
and then branded with a redhot iron on
the left ham. This done, the squealing prisoner
would surrender his place and attentions of the
audience to the next, and so on, until the whole
drove became duly registered. But farmers trading
among themselves, buying and selling stock,
depended entirely upon their sight and judgment
as to the valuation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">OHIO&mdash;EDUCATIONAL, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL.</span></h2>


<p>Ohio is the first of the contemplated states under
the Ordinance of 1787, and is the most important
if not the largest state in the Union. Although
geographers say there are some twenty-five
states larger, yet no one has ventured to
determine beyond dispute or contradiction just
how large Ohio is. When the lights of education
were limited to the “three R’s,” the boundary
was supposed to contain about thirty-nine
thousand square miles. In a short time after,
the size increased to forty thousand. The area
is described as the space between Lake Erie and
the Ohio river; and is usually estimated to contain
twenty-five million six hundred thousand
acres. But some advanced information has
changed these figures to forty-one thousand
square miles, and has shown by the state auditor’s
reports that nearly twenty-seven million acres of
farm lands were returned for taxation in 1833,
and the question still remains undetermined how
large the state is.</p>

<p>The state is greatly favored in regard to water
navigation, having Lake Erie on the north for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
two hundred and thirty miles, and the Ohio river
on the eastern and southern border for four hundred
and thirty-five miles, giving a natural water-way
around three sides of its boundary amounting
to six hundred and sixty-five miles, which is
more navigable water than is possessed by any
other state in the Union, except California and
Michigan.</p>

<p>The vast territory east of the Mississippi river,
of which Ohio formed a part, was claimed and
controlled by France, and was known as the
“North-western Territory,” or “Louisiana”, by
French traders and missionaries as early as 1658.
In 1679, La Salle established a sailing vessel on
Lake Erie, and trading posts were designated at
favorable points, and missionary work found its
way among the resident Indian tribes that occupied
the portion of territory now called Ohio.</p>

<p>France was made aware of the beauty of the
meager possession on this continent, and endeavored
by means of the natives and their missionaries
to keep the pre-emption warm until a
title could be better recognized. In 1794, Major
De Celoran, an officer of the French army, with
a force of several hundred men (French and Indian)
landed at a favorable point on Lake Erie,
and carried their boats overland to Chautauqua
Lake; from thence into the Alleghany and Ohio
rivers. And on the way down the Ohio river, it
is said this officer buried at numerous favorable
points lead plates bearing the proclamation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Louis XIV, asserting the dominion of France
over the territory on both sides of the Ohio river.
The titles of France were but little better than
the favorite grants and charters of James I, and
the American colonies soon began the establishment
of claims, which, in conflict, were settled
only by the defeat of the French by the British
at Quebec, and the treaty of Paris in 1763, by
which this territory was all ceded to Great
Britain; and the present good state was annexed
to Canada, and by proclamation amenable to the
government located at Quebec.</p>

<p>After the close of the War of Revolution, the
United States found the rights to the territory of
the great North-west in dispute between the Indians
and the colonies; and congress attempted
to settle the disputes by having the colonies
abandon all claims by ceding the same to the
United States as the common property of all.
New York set the patriotic example, and gave up
all her rights to a common cause and general
good, and was soon followed by other colonies
until the entire domain became vested in the
United States, excepting an unsurrendered claim
of Connecticut, in the northern part of the state
known as the Western Reserve, about fifty miles
wide and one hundred and twenty miles long.</p>

<p>The great North-west Territory, under the
supervision of the government, was divided up
and known under the following heads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The Seven Ranges and Congress Lands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>2. United States Military Lands.</p>

<p>3. The Ohio Company’s Purchase.</p>

<p>4. The Connecticut Reserve and Fire Lands.</p>

<p>5. The Military Bounty Lands.</p>

<p>6. The Virginia Military Bounty Lands.</p>

<p>7. Symmes’s Purchase.</p>

<p>8. Special Grants, Donation Tract, Refugees’
Tract, French Grant, Dorhman’s Grant, Moravian
and Lane’s Grants, Improvement Grants.</p>

<p>9. Canal, Turnpike, and Road Lands.</p>

<p>10. School, College and Ministerial Grants.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Congress lands are those sold by officers
of the Government. The Connecticut Reserve,
consisting of about 3,800,000 acres, was a claim
or grant made to the colony by Charles II in
1662. The “Fire Lands” were part of the grant,
and were donated by the colony to reimburse
losses sustained in property by the raids of Benedict
Arnold during the Revolutionary War. The
Fire Lands consisted of 500,000 acres, and were
located chiefly in Erie county.</p>

<p>Connecticut sold her Ohio lands to a “land
company for $1,200,000,” and placed it securely
as an endowment fund for common schools; and
the income from this source is still educating the
children of that highly intelligent state.</p>

<p>The United States Military Lands, made such
by act of Congress in 1796 to satisfy claims of
officers and soldiers of the War of the Revolution.
This tract embraced an area of 4,000
square miles in the counties of Morgan, Noble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Guernsey, Pickaway, Coshocton, Muskingum,
Perry, Fairfield and Franklin. Donation Tract
is 100,000 acres in the north part of Washington
county, granted to the Ohio Company by Congress.
The Symmes Tract of 311,682 acres was
granted to John Cleves Symmes, of New Jersey,
in 1794, for sixty-seven cents an acre. The land
lies between the two Miami rivers. Mr. Symmes’s
daughter married General Wm. Henry Harrison,
and was the grandmother of ex-President Harrison
the II.</p>

<p>The Refugee Lands is a grant of 100,000 acres.
It lies along the Scioto river, and the city of Columbus
stands upon this land, granted by Congress
to be given to persons driven out of the
British provinces during the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>The French Grant consists of 24,000 acres in
Scioto county, and given by Congress after the
fashion of hush money.</p>

<p>The Dorhman Grant is a tract of 23,000 acres
in Tuscarawas county, given by Congress to a
Portuguese merchant.</p>

<p>The Virginia Military Lands were located on
the west of the Scioto river. The amount of the
grant in acres has never been known. There are
fifteen counties in the tract and much of it has
never been surveyed. This body of land was reserved
by Virginia to pay her soldiers who were
in the Revolution without compensation or pay.
When it was determined by Congress to pay the
soldiers in land, each original settler marked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
own boundaries with a hatchet, and made a good
liberal guess that the area within his lines would
cover the acres given in his warrant.</p>

<p>The Moravian Grant was 4,000 acres in Tuscarawas
county. Besides, many other donations
were made for roads and other purposes, making
a total of over eight million acres, the greater
part of which went to creditors of the Government.
Land was the only thing the United
States had available to cancel the war obligations,
and soldiers and others gladly accepted
land certificates in lieu of those of silver or
gold.</p>

<p>Land in body was more desirable than town
lots. When Chillicothe was made capital of the
territory it had about twenty cabins promiscuously
located among the timber, which had not
yet been cut down to designate the streets. The
State House was constructed in 1800 by an old
revolutionary soldier, Wm. Rutledge, and remained
the Capitol until 1816, when it was permanently
located at Columbus, Franklin county.
The removal of the capital injured greatly the
prospects and business of Chillicothe for many
years, and secured leisure to its citizens, who engaged
in various innocent amusements for killing
time&mdash;in fact, lingered with scarcely a symptom
of lysis until after the “Literary, Astronomical
and Natural History Society” commenced the
publication and distribution of that illustrated
periodical (yearly), known and remembered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the last days of the older citizens, entitled “<cite>The
Ground Hog Almanac</cite>.” Since then the town has
grown in population, wealth and beauty, and is
now the center jewel of the cities in the rich
Scioto valley.</p>

<p>Provisions for the education of the generations
that were to inhabit the North-west were made
and ratified by Congress, in 1787, giving one-thirty-sixth
part of the entire public domain to
be reserved from sale for the maintenance of
schools, declaring “That schools and means of
education shall forever be encouraged.”</p>

<p>When Ohio was set off and became a state, the
reserve school lands were placed under the management
of the legislature, the constitution of
1802 making it the duty of that body to carry
out the educational clause of the ordinance, and
that the schools supported by the land grants
should be open for the reception of pupils. But
it turned out like many public trusts; with this
splendid endowment of near a million acres of
good land, the children of Ohio received no benefit
from that source, nor from any legislative
equivalent, for near half a century after settlement.
The majority of the people, it must be
confessed, were indifferent to the subject of education,
and were used to keep in power enough
imbecile legislators, who in defiance of Ephraim
Cutler, the wording of the constitution and acts
of Congress, spent the sessions for more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
twenty years in perverse legislation of the public
school lands.</p>

<p class="center">THE HISTORIC GROUND HOG CLUB.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Organized February 2, 1800</span>.</p>

<p class="center">Certificate of Membership.</p>

<p>The ground hog goes into his hole in the ground early in
the fall, and stays there until the 2d day of February, when,
regardless of the weather, he comes out; but, if he sees his
shadow, winter is not over, and he goes back to stay six weeks.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was stated by a member of the senate, at
the time, that every year things were made
worse&mdash;“That members of the legislature got
acts passed, under pretexts of granting leases to
themselves, relatives and political partisans,
giving the lands away until there was little or
nothing left.” One senator got acts passed giving
him and his children seven entire sections.
And legislation through ignorance, inability and
design subverted the intention in regard to the
school-land grant&mdash;squandered the proceeds, and
then pledged the state to pay the interest. And
for this pledge the citizen is annually taxed on a
fund of over four million dollars, which exists
nowhere excepting in name on the musty books of
the state.</p>

<p>But the young Buckeye Squirrel Hunter could
not be repressed; and fathers and mothers
labored hard and economized to help sustain
subscription schools to the full extent of their
financial ability; while the State of Connecticut
was supporting an expensive system of common
school education from a fund arising from the
sale of her lands in Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>The teachers of Ohio subscription schools were
not examined, nor did their patrons require a
very high standard of qualification. Still some
were highly educated wanderers over the earth,
as the literary works of H. D. Flood, John
Robinson and James Kelsey show; and who were
teachers in Southern Ohio from 1810 to 1825.
The greater number of instructors were well-informed
citizens, who accepted the opportunity
in order to pursue studies that would qualify
them for a more lucrative calling.</p>

<p>It was not customary to close the school on
holidays; nor even on Saturdays. They were
all hired by the month and were required to
perform the duties of teaching the full number
of working days in each calendar month&mdash;neither
Christmas, New Year nor Fourth of
July could close the <em>door</em>. The patrons were
the sole managers of these schools, and were
solicitous to obtain full consideration for the
amount paid. But young America was alive,
and the incentive a holiday by nature gave, could
not, under the most staid rules of conduct and
economy, be entirely suppressed; and it became
more contagious than measles or whooping-cough,
and every school in the country was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
broken out with the idea of a holiday&mdash;in parts
of two days&mdash;Christmas and New Year.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no way to treat it other
than to let it have its regular course. It always
came with a specific demand upon the
teacher, of which the following well-preserved
pattern specimen embraces the material points
of others, varying only in quantity and quality,
with locality and circumstances:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="ir1">“<em>December 23, 1817.</em></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. John Robinson</span> (Teacher)&mdash;</p>

<p>“<em>Sir</em>:&mdash;We the undersigned committee, in behalf
of the unanimous voice of the scholars of your
school, demand that you treat, according to
custom, to the following articles in amount
herein named, to wit:</p>

<p class="il2">200 ginger cakes,<br />
<span class="il1">2 bushels of hickory nuts,</span><br />
<span class="il1">1 peck hazel nuts,</span><br />
<span class="ilhalf">10 pounds of candy,</span><br />
<span class="ilhalf">10 pounds raisins,</span></p>

<p>delivered at the school house, noon hour, December
25, for the enjoyment and pleasant remembrance
of this school. If this meets your
approbation you will please sign and return the
paper to John Kelley to-morrow, December 24,
at noon, saying, over your signature, ‘I agree
to the above,’</p>

<div class="alignright">
<p class="displayinline">“<span class="smcap">John Kelley</span>,<br />
<span class="ilhalf"><span class="smcap">James Brown</span>,</span><br />
<span class="ilhalf"><span class="smcap">William Smallwood</span>,</span></p>
<p class="displayinline" style="font-size:3em; vertical-align:20%">}</p>
<p class="displayinline" style="vertical-align:100%"><em>Committee</em>.”</p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Occasionally a teacher not fond of fun or fearful
of exposure, would at once sign these modest
demands, and would join in with the children at
noon on Christmas, and again on New Year’s
day, and have a long to be remembered pleasant
jollification. But by far the greater number of
teachers preferred a little preliminary skirmishing
before acceding to the peremptory demand.
When the above bill of fare was handed the
teacher just before dismissal on the evening of
the 23d, he glanced over the contents and commenced
tearing the paper into small fragments.
And it was said this meant defiance.</p>

<p>The next morning was cold, with deep fall of
snow during the night; but all the larger boys
were inside of the school house with a hot fire and
armed with ropes and strings, and plenty of wood
and provisions to withstand a siege, before it was
yet light. All the openings were barricaded with
the benches, which consisted of heavy “puncheons,”
with wooden pins driven in on the convex
side for legs. One after another of the children
came and were admitted, and when the teacher
arrived, he found the house (cabin) full of jolly
boys and girls, but could not himself enter.</p>

<p>After many ineffectual efforts to obtain admission,
he started homeward. This was the signal
for the boys, and the yelping, whooping crowd of
all sizes and ages of minors, broke camp and gave
chase. Robinson is described as an athletic
specimen of vigorous manhood, and delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in sport, and concluded to give the boys a
fox chase through the forest and unbroken
snow. He led the gang quite easily for a short
time, but after several miles’ running the boys
captured and overpowered the fleeing despot.
Finding resistance useless he submitted to be
tied and roped down securely to pieces of timber
on either side with face in the direction of
the clouds. The burial ceremony was performed
by asking compliance, and marching around his
body, singing funeral dirges, and piling snow
upon his person.</p>

<p>A monument of snow was soon erected with an
opening for breathing and conversation. He did
not hold out long, and by pledging his honor the
bill of fare should be on hand, and no punishment
or ill-will entertained for the usage received, the
prisoner was released, and all returned to the
school-house, spelled for head, and were regularly
dismissed for home.</p>

<p>The next day at noon a cart-load of good things
arrived with those specified; and children and
parents enjoyed the feast, after which there was
an old-fashioned spelling-match, and all went
home to remember with pleasure the Christmas
of 1817. And at this writing (1895) only one of
that jolly crowd is known to be living, and from
whom the above reminiscences have been obtained.</p>

<p>The country was so thinly settled it was often
difficult to make up a school (fifteen), owing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
distance from the school cabin, and it was the
common practice for those most interested, usually
two or three neighbors, to “sign” for their
own children and enough more out of the range
to make up the required number. And often, in
order to secure them, agreeing to pay the tuition
and to board them during attendance. And so
far as the advantages of these schools were to be
obtained, the boys and girls shared alike. But if
unable to afford the expense for both, the boys
generally got the schooling.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Ohio School-house from 1796 to 1840.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The school-house was usually located in the
woods. The building was of round logs, and
presented the appearance of very little comfort,
either without or within. The floor was of mother
earth; the ceiling above, the underside of the
roof; a number of rude benches; a few puncheon
shelves, and a huge fire-place, constituted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
necessary arrangement of the interior. It was
known as the school-house, although used as
a place to hold elections, lectures, debating societies,
and singing-schools.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the loss of an endowment
much needed in primitive times, and the restriction
of subscription schools from existing poverty,
and that the log-cabin school-houses stood
empty for long periods, there was no effeminacy
in the desire for knowledge, for where there is a
will there is a way, and volumes might be filled
with learned and illustrious names who were
once rocked in a “sugar-trough,” and took their
first lessons in “<em>Brush College</em>.”</p>

<p>It was in this environment the scientist, statesman,
and divine obtained that self-confidence and
industry which leads to high and honored stations
and has made the North-west a perpetual
eclipsing shadow upon all other parts of the
United States.</p>

<p>In every department, the chosen citizen of this
magnificent empire has shown himself master of
the situation. In art, literature, and sciences; in
war and times of peace, he has given strength to
the Union and credit to a central power that will
surround itself with national influences the most
impregnable of any government in the world.
And under all the disadvantages&mdash;the absence of
public schools, and the opening up of a new
world isolated from civilization, he came forth
like a vision of beauty and glory from a chrysalis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
on which was written the destiny of future
greatness.</p>

<p>A short time before execution, John Brown
said&mdash;“I know the very errors by which my
scheme was marred were decreed before the world
was made. And I had no more to do with the
course I pursued than a shot leaving a cannon
has to do with the spot where it shall fall.”
That hunger and thirst for knowledge which prevailed
in the North-west seemed to contradict all
theories of man’s proneness under favorable circumstances
to degenerate, and favors the theory
advanced by the hero of Ossawatomie in regard
to power and purpose. Some of the first generation
of boys of Ohio (those that lived in the territory)
previous to 1796 were born elsewhere to
disappoint the Indians, but were all the same
shareholders of the great estate. And at the
early dawn of the present century many of these
young men found their way to Eastern institutions
of learning, taking the front in physical
and mental culture, as they did afterward in positions
of national honor.</p>

<p>As boys, squirrel hunters, men, scholars, lawyers,
soldiers, civilians, and statesmen, history
shows they filled their places well as American
models of superior manhood. Poor as the isolated
inhabitants were in regard to worldly goods,
they had an abundance of that which gave vitality,
energy, and power of will to do. It was
no uncommon thing for boys in this vast forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to obtain by their own efforts full preparation
to enter college, and with a knapsack of luncheon,
<em>tinder-box</em>, and scantily-filled purse, walk hundreds
of miles to a seat of learning, and there remain
four years without seeing home or friends until
they obtained the high honors of the institution.</p>

<p>Ex-Governor Seaberry Ford is but the sample
of many. When it came time to go to college,
the family of the young squirrel hunter was living
in a log cabin in the backwoods of Ohio.
His ambition, however, was for Yale, and so expressed
it. His father replied, “How are you to
get there!” The answer was, “I can walk,”
and did walk&mdash;reached Yale, where he remained
the “boss” young man of the town and institution
for four years, and returned to Ohio with the
first diploma issued by that college to an Ohio
boy. Many years without public schools papers or
libraries did not dampen the ardor of the young
for knowledge. The inhabitants were destitute
of a circulating medium, but managed to keep
apace with all the world in that synonym for
power. The means employed, as given in the
autobiography of one of the first two college
graduates in the North-west, illustrates well the
thousands of that and later dates who managed
to obtain books, and worked their way to the
highest standard of education.</p>

<p>The Hon. Thomas Ewing says&mdash;“About this
time” (1803) “the neighbors in our and the surrounding
settlements met and agreed to purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
books and make a common library. They were
all poor and subscriptions small, but they raised
in all about one hundred dollars.</p>

<p>“All my accumulated wealth, ten coon-skins,
went into the fund, and Squire Sam Brown, of
Sunday Creek, who was going to Boston, was
charged with the purchase. After the absence of
many weeks he brought the books to Captain
Ben Brown’s in a sack on a pack-horse. I was
present at the untying of the sack and pouring
out the treasure. There were about sixty volumes,
I think, and well selected; the library of
the Vatican was nothing to it, and there never
was a library better read. This with occasional
additions furnished me with reading while I remained
at home.</p>

<p>“Dec. 17, 1804, the library was fully established
and christened, ‘The Coon-skin Library,’
and a librarian duly elected by shareholders.”</p>

<p>Five years later, at the age of nineteen, with
consent of his father, young Ewing left home to
procure means to obtain a collegiate education.
He set out on foot and found his way through the
woods from his home in Athens county to the
Ohio river, and from thence to the Kanawha
Salt Works, where he engaged as a day laborer,
and in three months saved enough money to pay
his way at school through the winter at Athens
College. He became well satisfied with the success
so far, and in the spring returned to the Salt
Works and made money enough to pay off some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
indebtedness that was troubling his father, devoting
the winter to the study of some new books
obtained by the “Coon-skin Library.”</p>

<p>The third year he returned with enough to induce
him to enter college as a regular student,
where he remained until 1815; and, after taking
the degree of A. M., returned to the Salt Works,
and earned enough to aid in the study of law.
Thus, ten years were spent as a necessary apprenticeship&mdash;performing
the arduous and monotonous
labors of boiling salt, that he might be
enabled to cultivate the various talents nature
had so bounteously bestowed upon him, and at
the same time avoid financial embarrassments.</p>

<p>Many thousands of squirrel hunters since have
imitated the example of this great man, and have
arisen to high eminence, but none&mdash;not one&mdash;to
the height of “The Ohio Salt-boiler”&mdash;the greatest
man America ever produced. In stature Mr.
Ewing was six feet two inches tall&mdash;well proportioned,
with remarkable physical ability. It is
related&mdash;that many years after athletical exercises
had been lain aside for law, on passing near
the old court-house in Lancaster, Ohio, he found
a crowd of able-bodied men who had been trying
to throw an ax, handle and all, over the building,
but it could not be done. Mr. Ewing halted, and
took the ax by the handle and sent it sailing five
feet or more above the building and passed on.</p>

<p>Mr. Ewing was great from the fact he was familiar
with the little things of life, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the greater matters in the supreme court, where
he chiefly practiced. Daniel Webster acknowledged
Mr. Ewing’s superior abilities in seeking
his aid in his difficult and weighty cases.</p>

<p>In the Senate of the United States, he introduced
many important bills&mdash;and opposed Clay’s
Compromise&mdash;the amendatory fugitive slave law
of 1850&mdash;and advocated the abolition of slavery
in the District of Columbia. As a statesman and
educated in a free state, he had none of that diffidence,
timidity, and submission to slave-holding
dictation so commonly witnessed among northern
legislators in Congress, and before their constituents.</p>

<p>The influence of slavery was felt in the education
and lives of the people of the North-west.
As race hatred was transplanted into Ohio in the
early settlements, it soon became a political element
that caused many odious and unchristian
laws to be placed on the statute books, and enforced
as vigorously against color as if made in
the interests of slavery and bonded ignorance of
the state.</p>

<p>The first State Constitution of Ohio, adopted
in 1802, in article 8, “That the general, great,
and essential principles of liberty and free government
may be recognized, and forever unalterably
established, we declare”&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sec. 1. “That all men are born equally free
and independent, and have certain natural, inherent,
and unalienable rights, among which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the enjoying and defending life and liberty; acquiring,
possessing, and protecting property, and
pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.”</p>

<p>Sec. 2. “There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude in this state, otherwise than
for the punishment of crimes, whereof the party
shall have been duly convicted.”</p>

<p>Sec. 3. ... “That schools, and the means
of instruction, shall forever be encouraged by
legislative provision, not inconsistent with the
rights of conscience.”</p>

<p>Sec. 25. “That no law shall be passed to prevent
the poor in the several counties and townships
within this state from an equal participation
in the schools, academies, colleges, and universities
within this state, which are endowed, in
whole or in part, from the revenue arising from
the donations made by the United States for the
support of schools and colleges; and the doors of
the said schools, academies, and universities shall
be open for the reception of scholars, students,
and teachers of every grade, <em>without any distinction</em>
or preference whatever contrary to the intent
for which the said donations were made.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still the colored man, under no circumstances,
excepting taxation, was recognized as a citizen.
He was by Article IV of the Constitution of Ohio
disfranchised by the word “white”&mdash;no other
color could enjoy the rights of an elector. He
was by law deprived of schools and means of
instruction contrary to the spirit of the endowment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
as well as expressions of the constitution;
and for more than forty years the colored population
sojourned in a wilderness of freedom before
it was discovered that manhood has rights all are
bound to respect&mdash;one of which is the right of
suffrage.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the population forming
the new state were favorable to freedom, and
many were known to have emancipated their
slaves and settled in Ohio that they might wipe
out the stains of an institution which had so
truthfully been denominated the “sum of all villainies.”
There were, however, others, in almost
every neighborhood, who by nature were the patrons
of the slave-hunter and looked upon a
colored man as unworthy of an existence on
earth, and delighted in tormenting, killing,
or driving him from his home and neighborhood.</p>

<p>This race hatred in some parts of the state received
so much attention and cultivation, that
many well-meaning people encouraged the prejudice,
in view of the peace of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Cincinnati did more than all the rest of the
border towns in keeping up and disseminating a
<em>violent</em> race hatred. Free respectable colored people
were looked upon, denounced, and treated as
a nuisance, “having no rights a white man was
bound to respect.” The city harbored if not encouraged
a lot of miscreants, who made it a
business to hunt and capture runaway slaves for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the reward; and also to carry on the money making
business of kidnaping free blacks, carrying
them across the river, and selling them into slavery.
Any and every unlawful treatment they received
was winked at by citizens and city authorities.</p>

<p>The courts were open, but until S. P. Chase
went to Cincinnati in 1830 the black man could
procure no counsel, as a white man could easily
ruin his character and standing by manifesting
the least sympathy for the persecuted. When the
Hon. Salmon P. Chase defended one of these
down-trodden creatures in the courts of Cincinnati,
after the hearing of the case, a prominent
man of the city said, pointing to Mr. Chase,
“There goes a promising young lawyer who has
ruined himself.”</p>

<p>But the state outside of Cincinnati had enough
of the right element to enforce, if necessary, at
all times, the fifth paragraph of the eighth article
of the state constitution, which affirmed,
“That the <em>people</em> shall be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and possessions, from all unwarrantable
searches and seizures; and that the general
warrants whereby an officer may be commanded
to search suspected places, without probable
evidence of the fact committed, or to seize
any person or persons not named whose offenses
are not particularly described, and without oath
or affirmation, are dangerous to liberty, and <em>shall</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
<em>not be granted</em>.” Still in matters of legislation
Cincinnati managed to secure her influence
against the negro.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the plain wording of the Constitution
of the State, laws were enacted to keep
the black and mulatto people out of Ohio. These
were the much discussed “black laws”&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>First.</em> A black or mulatto person was prohibited
settlement unless he could show a certificate
of freedom and the names of two freeholders as
security for his good behavior and maintenance,
in the event of becoming a public charge; and
unless the certificate of freedom was duly recorded
and produced, it was a <em>penal offense to give
employment to a black or mulatto</em>.</p>

<p><em>Second.</em> Colored and mulattoes were excluded
from the schools; and,</p>

<p><em>Third.</em> No black or mulatto could testify in court
in any case where a white person was concerned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1848, Dr. N. S. Townshend, of Lorain
county, and Dr. John F. Morse, of Lake county,
were elected members of the legislature as “abolitionists.”
To these two members, fortunately,
holding the balance of power between the Whigs
and Democrats, are due the repeal of the odious
“black laws,” and the election of an “abolition”
United States Senator&mdash;S. P. Chase.</p>

<p>To these men, in combination with the Democrats,
is not only due the repeal of existing laws,
but, also, provisions for schools for black and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
mulatto children. And Ohio became reclaimed
in favor of freedom, and all was bright and lovely
and prosperous&mdash;but not all happy; for there still
remained a black, disgraceful, disfiguring spot on
the face of the Goddess of Liberty&mdash;a spot that
was causing millions to mourn.</p>

<p>Early in the Union of the States, slavery caste
began to isolate itself from every thing denominated
“Yankee North,” and, at the same time,
disseminated a race hatred against the “nigger”
among the ignorant white and poor people of the
South. And, in the line of emigration, Ohio received
a larger share of immigrants who had been
taught to despise the “nigger,” and honestly believed
a colored man was an inferior animal,
“destitute of a soul;” and lecturers were often
traveling over the state entertaining large audiences
with such crude material as that&mdash;“A nigger
is not human&mdash;the bones in the hands and
feet are entirely different; and he is nothing more
or less than an improved Orang-outang, and
made to be a slave to the human race as much
as a horse or cow.” By lowering the natural
status of the colored man, such audiences became
elevated and the space between man and the
monkey widened by comparison making room
for increased hatred. At all times, but most especially
so, previous to the odious amendments
of the “Fugitive Slave Law,” in 1850, it was no
uncommon thing to see calls signed by numerous
citizens inserted in popular newspapers, asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
all persons in favor of “law and order” to assemble
at the time and place specified to put down
abolitionism, and to let their “<em>southern brethren</em>”
know the people of Ohio were in favor of the
constitution and preservation of the Union of the
States.</p>

<p>A call for a meeting of this kind in a central
county of the state, and announced in the official
political paper of the time, dated October 3, 1835,
is headed in large type&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">“<em>Anti-Abolition Meeting.</em></p>

<p>“A meeting of those opposed to the wild projects
of abolitionists is proposed to be held at
the court-house in Circleville, on Saturday, the
10th day of October next, at 1 o’clock <span class="smcap">P. M.</span></p>

<p>“All those who love their country and are willing
to maintain her constitution&mdash;</p>

<p>“All who are friends to order and would avert
the horrors of a servile war&mdash;</p>

<p>“All who know slavery to be an evil, but believe
a dissolution of our National Union a greater
evil&mdash;</p>

<p>“All who deprecate ecclesiastical influence in
political affairs, are respectfully and earnestly invited
to attend the proposed meeting, when a
number of addresses will be delivered.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This call is signed by four hundred and seventy-three
names, citizens of a town having less than
two thousand inhabitants. The next issue of the
paper publishing the call, and previous to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
time of meeting, contained an anonymous, but
scathing criticism of such movements, in which
the author of the article says: “It has been
shown what is the real state of the anti-slavery
question, and the unreasonableness and utter
groundlessness of the outcry against Abolitionists.”
“Further we would state for the serious
consideration of our opponents that we are persuaded
that the ‘Union will be dissolved,’ not if
this subject be discussed, but if it be not. If it
be true that the social compact was formed on
the condition of slavery being tolerated by the
free states, then it is such an Union as must
sooner or later be dissolved.”... “Admitting
the existence of a God, and that God is a
being of perfect equity, can it be believed that
He will suffer such a combination against the
happiness of man to exist forever? And has it
not already existed too long for that unity of
counsel in this great republic which should ever
mark the doings of a nation? And can we calculate
on a much longer forbearance?” The editors
of the paper, after offering an apology for
publishing the article, of which the above quotations
are but a small part, say: “Will some
Abolitionist be so kind as to refer us to the passage
in our Constitution or Declaration of Independence
which asserts that all men are created
free and equally; we have not seen it.”</p>

<p>The meeting came off as advertised, and the
chairman said: “Deeply sympathizing with our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
‘<em>Southern brethren</em>,’ we have assembled to express
our most unqualified opposition to emancipation
and disapprobation of the course pursued by its
advocates; and to assure our fellow-citizens in
the Southern States that we regard their constitutional
rights as our own, and that we will to
the utmost aid them in the defense of those
rights.” “Therefore, Resolved,” was followed
by ten long resolutions in praise of fidelity to the
South and opposition to emancipation, winding
up with the following:</p>

<p>“Resolved, That were the slave-holders now
willing to abolish slavery, in our opinion the immediate
and unconditional emancipation of all
the slaves in the United States, without providing
for their colonization, would render the condition
of both the whites and blacks infinitely
worse than it now is, and would be an act of palpable
and unpardonable inhumanity to the
<em>slaves</em>.”</p>

<p>Signed: Valentine Kieffer, President; Nathan
Perrill, John Entrekin, Wm. Renick, Sr., Vice-Presidents;
Elias Bentley, W. N. Foresman, A.
Huston, Secretaries.</p>

<p>All the officers were well-known and prominent
people, and it is not strange that persons of
such note and intelligence should have given
their approbation and signatures of approval to
such a meeting, when we reflect that most pro-slavery
men in the free states had been taught to
believe or say: If the slaves were liberated, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
would come north in swarms and “<em>steal our chickens</em>,”
and destroy the peace of society “<em>by marrying
every good-looking white woman in the
country</em>.”</p>

<p>But there existed no occasion for alarm; the
slave-holding states South never had an inclination
to emancipate their slaves. <em>They</em> were the
wealth of that country, and its growing greatness
fostered the desire to found an aristocratic
empire on slave labor. The number in bondage
was rapidly increasing and their labor was becoming
more and more remunerative. They had
but to see the increase of this wealth and its
products in fifty years, to stimulate the desire to
found a government on the aristocracy of the institution.</p>

<p>In 1810, there were in all the states but 1,191,360
slaves; and notwithstanding New England,
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania had in
the meantime liberated theirs&mdash;and the African
slave trade had previously been abolished&mdash;the
underground railroad had been doing a lively
business&mdash;and the manumissions and colonizations
that were going on in the “breeding states”&mdash;in
1860 the number had increased to within a
small fraction less than four millions.</p>

<p>Slave labor was exceedingly profitable in the
cotton states, as the increase of the cotton product
shows. In 1801, these states only produced
48,000,000 pounds, while 1860 returned 2,054,698,800
pounds. There were, however, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
things inserted in the government plat that were
unsatisfactory: “That all men are created equal”
in natural rights, and the Missouri Compromise&mdash;the
thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north
latitude, Mason and Dixon’s line. It was not so
clear as they wished it might be, that “unalienable
rights,” “life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness,” belonged only to masters; and when
the failure to rescind the “Compromise” in 1853
occurred through democratic influence, of such
men as Albert P. Edgerton, the possibility of
peacefully enlarging the area of slavery became
as hopeless as it was manifestly evident that
bondage and freedom could not much longer
remain peaceably in the same government. And
with amendments to the fugitive slave law the
Southern political bosses, who had usurped the
control of the national government, knew the
constitution found slavery in the states, and as a
state institution left its local existence to the
chances of state laws. They knew full well it
was not made a national institution and that the
time was close at hand when they must go to the
rear or abandon their northern allies and set up
a slavocracy for themselves. They had obtained
sufficient to know Lloyd Garrison, Wendell
Phillips, Arthur Tappan and the Boston Liberator
were actual facts; and the large meetings
of the “dough faces” and their expressions of
sympathy was not the kind of “Soothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Syrup” the South desired, although giving great
encouragement to secession.</p>

<p>The division of sentiment existing in the free
states in regard to the rights of slavery and its
extension became more and more expressive,
especially along the border lines of the opposing
institutions. Consequently Ohio felt a full share
of the evils due to political and social disturbances
arising from this cause. But the intercommunications
given by railroads and the
light emanating from a free and fearless press&mdash;cheap
postage and speedy transportation&mdash;infused
new life; and mankind began thinking&mdash;thinking
differently from that of past times when
the postage on a letter was twenty-five cents and
required four days for an individual to travel one
hundred miles and return.</p>

<p>Slave hunting in the land of the free did not
prove an agreeable or profitable occupation.
The oppressed fugitive generally found friends
enough in the North to secure the boon he sought.
In almost every community could be found the
spirit contained in the lines by Whittier, expressed
for George W. Lattimer, who with his
wife escaped from Norfolk, Va., in 1841, and
was found in Boston. He was the first slave
hunted in the North, and was arrested and proceedings
began to have him returned to slavery.
His cause was championed by such men as
William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips and
Frederick Douglass. The court ruled against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the fugitive and his liberty was purchased by the
good people of Boston. Lattimer gained great
notoriety, and after a long and eventful life died
at his home in Lynn, Mass., May 30, 1896,
aged seventy-five years. And it can not well be
disputed that much of the after changes in public
sentiment in regard to the status of the colored
man, and his rights in a free state, was brought
about by the object lessons in the enforcement
of the odious fugitive slave law. “All that was
necessary to prove the detestable character of
this iniquity and its dangers to liberty was
simply to enforce it.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Still the corrupting influences
of trade made the evils of slavery felt in
the social, moral and educational interests of the
entire state; and consequently citizens, who had
in their hearts the logical idea that all men are
born free and equal, saw the hand of tyranny
quite as much on either shore of the river, that
constituted geographically the dividing line.</p>

<p>This was more especially true of Cincinnati,
where large interests in trade enabled the sentiments
of the few to dominate and regulate public
acts and opinions parallel with steamboat monopoly,
and the creed of the “Divine Institution,”
as much as if the city had been located
considerably south of “Mason and Dixon’s line;”
and as late as 1836 a free soil newspaper, “The
Philanthropist,” was destroyed by a mob of leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
citizens of Cincinnati, and which will ever
remain a historical record of loyalty to the institution
on the opposite side of the river, and as
penance for some manifestation in favor of
freedom.</p>

<p>The Philanthropist was a newspaper ably edited
by James G. Birney. After being published
some three months, at night, July 14, 1836, the
press-room was broken open by well-known citizens
of Cincinnati, and the press materials all
destroyed. No attempt was made to punish the
perpetrators. But rather to sanction the act.
A call for a meeting of the citizens was made for
July 23d, stating the purpose to be, “<em>to decide
whether the people of Cincinnati will permit the publication
or distribution of ‘abolition’ papers in the
city</em>.”</p>

<p>The decision of this mass meeting, composed
of the business men of the city, was afterwards
published in a leading local paper, and makes
very good reading, although derived from a pro-slavery
source, to wit: “On Saturday night,
July 30th, very soon after dark, a concourse of
citizens assembled at the corner of Main and
Seventh streets, in this city, and, upon a short
consultation, broke open the printing office of the
Philanthropist, the abolition paper, scattered the
type into the street, tore down the presses, and
completely dismantled the office. It was owned
by A. Pugh, a peaceable and orderly printer, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
printed the Philanthropist for the Anti-Slavery
Society of Ohio.</p>

<p>“From the printing office the crowd went to
the house of A. Pugh, where they supposed there
were other printing materials, but found none,
<em>nor offered any violence</em>. Then to Messrs. Donaldsons,
where only ladies were at home. The residence
of Mr. Birney, the editor, was then visited;
no person was at home but a youth, upon whose
explanations the house was <em>left undisturbed</em>....
And proceeded to the ‘Exchange’ and took refreshments.”...
“An attack was then made
upon the residences of some blacks in Church
alley; two guns were fired upon the assailants
and they recoiled.... It was some time
before the rally could again be made, several
voices declaring they did not wish to endanger
themselves. A second attack was made, the
houses found empty, and their interior contents
destroyed.”</p>

<p>Although all this kind of proceeding looked
very much like an unlawful assemblage, it met
with no opposition from the city authorities, and
all that was ever done in a matter of this kind
was to call a meeting of citizens, and “<em>regret the
cause of the recent occurrences</em>,” and the next day
would drive a Wendell Phillips from Pike’s
Opera House, and seek him with a howling mob
that he might be hung to a lamp-post, “the
mayor refusing to allow the police to interfere.”</p>

<p>Cincinnati reaped a rich harvest for the examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
given in “citizen” mobs. Still, at any time
previous to the “<em>salvation</em>” of the city, it was impolitic
if not dangerous for a minister of the gospel,
a public speaker, press or private citizen, to
mention the subject of slavery in a manner that
might be construed unfavorable to its sanctity;
for a black line had been drawn over the twenty-sixth
verse of the seventeenth chapter of the Acts
of the Apostles; the tenth verse of the second
chapter of Malachi, and the spirit of the gospel
dispensation, as effectually in their practical
theology as was ever manifest in Danville or in
any Southern translation of the ten commandments.</p>

<p>So determined were the pro-slavery elements
to hold the fort in Cincinnati and aid the South
in making it dangerous for a colored man in a
“free state,” that they continued to supply the
South with stores until the last moment; and
only a week before the bombardment of Sumter,
the city permitted cannon to pass through on way
from Baltimore marked</p>

<p class="center">“<em>For the Southern Confederacy,</em><br />
<span class="il8"><em>Jackson, Mississippi.</em>”</span></p>

<p>And the same day, or the day before, returned
a fugitive slave through the commissioner, and
all went well with the city, reaping the fruits of
the war, until General Wallace placed it under
martial law, and, suspending business, demanded
the citizens to enroll themselves for defense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
“Some were at once taken very sick, others were
hunted up by detailed soldiers, who turned them
out of barns, kitchens, garrets, cellars, closets,
from under beds, and in the disguise of women’s
clothing.” For the seed sown was now ripe and
mid air was resounding&mdash;“<em>The harvest is here.</em>”</p>

<p>At a time, in 1858, when public sentiment was
beginning to be felt, and official prosecutions for
the return of fugitive slaves became more or less
unsatisfactory to the owners, James Buchanan,
President of the United States, gave a surprise
to every one by appointing Judge Stanley Matthews&mdash;an
eminent lawyer, ex-editor of an abolition
paper, and leader in the anti-slavery movements
in Ohio, as United States District Attorney
for the Southern District of Ohio.</p>

<p>To politicians, this seemed not only a deviation
from all known precedents, but, politically, an
unfathomable mystery. But, no more remarkable
was the appointment than that, a lawyer at
the summit of professional ability and large income&mdash;a
noted abolitionist&mdash;opposed to the fugitive
slave acts, should have accepted the position.
But those who knew Judge Matthews and
his patriotism best, could discern in it logical
conclusions&mdash;the interests of freedom could be
subserved and the public mind attained by a
shorter method than by arguing, speaking, or
publishing&mdash;“<em>the enforcement of the iniquitous fugitive
slave law</em>.” And for three years he prosecuted
“offenders” <em>without</em> just fault or favor&mdash;giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
such lessons in its application, that made
loyalty to freedom, and magnified the blessings
of the free.</p>

<p>Judge Matthews resigned the office in 1861,
and took the commission of Lieutenant-Colonel
in the Twenty-third&mdash;afterward Colonel of the
Fifty-first Ohio, and awaited the “proclamation.”</p>

<p>During Judge Matthews’ entire service as
United States District Attorney, the slave states
were secluded as pertaining to things and persons
of the “North”&mdash;papers, books, teachers, preachers,
and citizens were effectually ostracized;
northern colleges and seminaries had their southern
patronage withdrawn; and, finally, when,
by the aid of the Secretary of War, they secured
large quantities of United States arms and military
supplies, and felt thoroughly prepared and
equipped, the states stepped out of the Union
with defiance, leaving poor Kentucky with a
governor that threatened to chastise either of the
belligerents if they dared to interfere with her
“<em>neutrality</em>.” And it is not known to history
that either the cotton states or neutral Kentucky
ever gave Judge Matthews a vote of thanks for
his vigorous enforcement of the fugitive law.
But this is not all. In 1876, Judge Matthews ran
for Congress in the Second District of Cincinnati,
and his defeat, says the biographer,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was in consequence
of an act of his while United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
District Attorney&mdash;that while he had the office he
prosecuted W. B. Connelly, a white resident of
Cincinnati, and reporter of the Gazette, for giving
to a young runaway slave and his wife “a glass
of water and piece of bread”&mdash;a <em>crime</em> under the
fugitive slave law. It was shown that the negroes
were captured and were shut up in Connelly’s
room, and while there they were furnished
“bread and water.” It was further shown, that
a letter was written by Connelly, as a Master
Mason, to Judge Matthews, as a brother Mason,
in which he confessed that he had “furnished the
negroes with food.”</p>

<p>But, with all these influential relations, the
offense was prosecuted&mdash;Connelly found guilty
and was sentenced to serve time of imprisonment.
“The publication of these facts destroyed Judge
Matthews’ chance for Congress,” and that his
brother Masons obtained full credit for his defeat
can not well be doubted.</p>

<p>It is not stated that any <em>promise</em> had been made
by Judge Matthews&mdash;<em>none violated</em>; and differed
materially from ordinary cases, like that of O.
A. Gardner, a Master Mason, arrested for robbing
the mails at Minneapolis, who said in court
that his confession was made to Postal Inspector
Gould, a brother Mason, on the promise that
Gould, as a fellow Mason, would see that he was
acquitted&mdash;“that his acquittal was assured&mdash;that
the judge, the lawyers on both sides, and most
of the jury were <em>Masons</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Judge Matthews had taken the oath of office
as district attorney, which to him was above all
other oaths, and was not the man to play the
Marshal Ney performance. And it would seem
the “defeat for congress” was not “the consequence
of an <em>act of his</em>” as much as it was his
declining to “act” crooked for the benefit of a
brother Mason.</p>

<p>If any one now thinks it impossible that a free
people in the North could be so influenced, cowed,
and blinded to the atrocities of slavery upon the
free, let them read the biography of Southern
prisons. It was a day of jubilee for the abolitionists
(who had survived the horrid cruelties
that made “Libby” a paradise) when the federal
forces took possession of the South. The Rev.
Calvin Fairbanks, after being kidnapped and
serving horrible time for seventeen years and
four months for being an abolitionist, was released
from the state prison of Kentucky, at
Frankfort, by a special order of President Lincoln.</p>

<p>During the last two wardens of the prison&mdash;Zeb
Ward and that of J. W. South&mdash;this man received
thirty-five thousand stripes on his bare
body with a strap of half-tanned leather a foot
and a half long, often dipped in water to increase
the pain. He was often whipped four times a
day, receiving seventy stripes at each whipping;
one time the number of lashes was increased to
one hundred and seven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>All this punishment was pretended to be inflicted
on the grounds of failure to perform the
daily task which had been fixed beyond possibility&mdash;requiring
the prisoner to weave two hundred
and eight yards of hemp cloth daily.</p>

<p>Early in 1864, Mr. Lincoln learned through
Miss Tileston of the cruelties practiced upon Mr.
Fairbanks, and sent General Fry to Kentucky
with orders to make it “Fairbanks Day” at
Frankfort prison.</p>

<p>“When released, Mr. Fairbanks says he crossed
the river and kissed the free soil in Ohio,” where
he met the girl who, on hearing of his misfortune
in Massachusetts, came to Ohio and engaged as
teacher at Hamilton, and then at Oxford, supplying
him with such comforts as was within her
power&mdash;worked and petitioned and watched over
the border for many long years with the love of
a true woman.</p>

<p>Slavery is no more&mdash;the dark blotch to freedom
has been wiped out with the best blood of the
nation. It was a contentious, political evil as
well. But slavery of the colored race is not the
only evil, the only danger, that can arise to overthrow
a Republican form of government.</p>

<p>The first thirty-five years of the existence of
Ohio as a state may be recognized, in an educational
point of view, as the period of the
“<em>Three R’s</em>”&mdash;“<em>readin, ’riten, and ’rithmetic</em>”&mdash;for
state legislation made it so. There were no
public schools, no academy, but one higher institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in operation, called an “Ohio University,”
located at Athens, in Athens county.
This was opened for students, in 1809, with the
classic course; and the first class, numbering
two, graduated in 1815, receiving the first collegiate
degrees ever conferred under the endowment
for education by the act of 1787&mdash;John
Hunter, A. M., and Thomas Ewing, A. M.</p>

<p>This university was in financial straits all this
time with an incomplete corps of professors, for the
reason the legislature had manipulated the land
endowments (46,000 acres) from time to time
until little or nothing was received, where large
incomes should have been realized. And the
good intent of land grants for educational purposes
in Ohio proved a signal failure in common
schools, academies, and colleges.</p>

<p>After ineffectual efforts of mongrel state universities
to supply the pressing wants of rising
generations, sectarian institutions multiplied
rapidly, and the state soon became honored with
numerous chartered seats of learning representing
all religions from Roman Catholic (down, or up,
which ever it may seem) to the Free Will Baptist.
Of these, Oberlin has taken the lead. It
was chartered, in 1834, under the direction of
the Congregational Church, with a theological
seminary attached as part of the institution.
Both sexes and all colors have been admitted to
its classes.</p>

<p>During the struggle in Ohio to establish a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
satisfactory system of education, the good people
of Kentucky claimed to be greatly in advance in
regard to facilities, and sold large numbers of
scholarships to those who desired to embrace
better opportunities to obtain an education, before
it was discovered that young men from a free
state, or states, attending those seats of learning
had little or no spare time for mental culture,
after giving the physical enough attention to
keep all its members intact; as free-state students
were obliged to fight or “eat dirt.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">School-house of 1851, in which President Garfield taught.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The writer still holds the larger end of an
uncanceled scholarship in one of the then leading,
but now defunct, college institutions.</p>

<p>As late as 1837, there was no public school system
operating in Ohio. But the year following a law
was passed for the purpose of adopting a system
on a uniform footing. Still it required that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
teachers should be qualified <em>only</em> in reading,
writing and arithmetic. Amendments and improvements,
however, went on, and in 1847 the
“State Teachers’ Association” was organized,
and deserves great credit for the good work done
and still doing in obtaining beneficial legislation
and raising the standard of teachers and the
curriculum of “High Schools.” And at the
present time Ohio compares favorably with other
states in regard to her system for general and
liberal education, regardless of color or previous
condition.</p>

<p>Information derived from newspapers was
measurably lost&mdash;the inefficient postal service
prevented the circulation of metropolitan papers;
and those published in Ohio for half a century
were under the ban of slavery. And with the
censorship of Kentucky and the cotton states it
is not surprising they were short-lived and unattended
with prosperity. The first paper published
in the North-west was printed in Cincinnati,
November 9, 1793, under the name of
“The Sentinel of the North-western Territory.”
The journal was owned and edited by William
Maxwell. Newspapers in those days were comparatively
small and poorly executed in presswork;
and changed names, ownership or ceased
to exist so frequently that not a few attempts at
journalism became lost to history.</p>

<p>During the territorial days, and while the
seat of government tarried at Chillicothe, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Willis, the father of N. P., the poet, author
and artist, published a literary paper for a short
time. After the capital became permanently
located at Columbus, Philo H. Olmstead, from
1813 to 1818, published “The Western Intelligencer”&mdash;then
changed the name to “Columbus
Gazette” and in due time to “Columbus Journal.”</p>

<p>Small as these and other beginnings were over
the settled portions of the state, the press and
its influence became of more and more importance,
and kept pace if not in advance of many
other leading departments connected with an advanced
civilization. As ideas beget ideas, so inventions
beget inventions, until time and space
are no more, and the wild elements meekly bow
in submission to the will and works of man. If
John Gutenberg, Fust, Mentel or Koster, with
their little inventions, could see the automatic
working of one of those mammoth printing machines,
which noiselessly move with such rapidity,
exactness and intelligence&mdash;even putting human
volition and precision to shame&mdash;any one or
all of the once contesting discoverers would stop
disputing in astonished wonderment long enough
to set up and strike off on their own inventions
a single line, in quotations, “Large trees from
small acorns grow,” and abandon further contention.</p>

<p>Newspaper educators at an early day, like the
schoolmaster, had a limited showing in a country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
so financially short. Editors and publishers
could not conduct the business without a given
amount of support. But this needful requirement
was too manifestly uncertain to justify an
expensive venture; for there was little or no
money in the country, nor means to procure it
by exchanges. Still, the experiment was occasionally
made, but most generally failed even
in the hands of the most economical management
and moderate expectations.</p>

<p>The following is a brief of a four-paged paper,
ten by fifteen inches in size&mdash;“No. 33, Vol. I.”&mdash;dated
June 5, 1818. This paper was started at
the county seat of one of the early settled localities,
and in agriculture one of the leading counties
in the state. This number treats of the following
subjects:</p>

<p>The deplorable condition of the press of Ohio
at the time is so graphically and candidly set
forth by the editors of the Olive Branch&mdash;the
only paper published in the county&mdash;in their
last appeal for support, is better illustrated by
reproducing the article entire:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center largefont" style="line-height:0.5em">“PROSPECTS</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">For Continuing the Publication of</span><br />
<span class="largefont" style="line-height:2em">THE OLIVE BRANCH.</span></p>

<p>“The publishers now call upon the citizens of &mdash;&mdash; county,
and the country adjacent, to determine
if they shall continue publishing <cite>The Olive
Branch</cite>. They have fully and firmly determined
to discontinue its publication, unless the number
of their subscribers is considerably increased.
They apprehend their present number will not
pay the expense of the establishment; and they
do not think themselves able, nor are they under
obligations, to lose more by it than they have lost
already.</p>

<p>“If, therefore, the citizens of the county are
desirous that a paper should be published at this
place, and if any think <em>this</em> worthy of their
patronage, let them declare it by adding their
names to the list of our subscribers. By this
declaration, yea or nay, when fully and explicitly
made known, we shall positively abide.</p>

<p>“Some persons ask, ‘What is to be the <em>character</em>
of our paper?’ And what <em>inducements</em> we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
offer them to become subscribers? In a few
words we will tell them: Its character shall be
truly American and Republican. Americans by
birth and education, we have no partiality for
European institutions or policy. <em>Republicans</em> in
principle, we will never disseminate aristocratical
or monarchical doctrines. We will ever oppose,
with our utmost endeavors, their progress. We
do fearlessly declare perpetual war against them.
Believing our forms of government infinitely
superior to any ever before witnessed, we will
rather perish in their defense than sit silent spectators
of their destruction.</p>

<p>“We will ever respect and inculcate virtue,
both public and private, and deprecate vice in all
its dazzling forms. Nothing shall ever appear in
our columns to disturb the present public tranquillity,
unless we see danger lurking therein,
which duty requires us to expose to public view.
We hold the Christian religion in sacred veneration,
and shall never, therefore, suffer an aspersion
to be cast upon it through our columns.</p>

<p>“As the happiness of most of mankind lies in
their social domestic circles, we shall hold them
sacred. We will never designedly cast into them
the apple of discord; nor will we knowingly
cause a pang to the <em>honest heart</em> or a blush upon
‘the modest cheek.’</p>

<p>“The <em>inducements</em> we offer are:</p>

<p>“<em>First</em>&mdash;A weekly account of the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
events and transactions occurring in our own
country.</p>

<p>“<em>Secondly</em>&mdash;An account of such as transpire in
other parts of the globe affecting us; and among
these, every thing important relative to our Mexican
and South American neighbors will have a
preference.</p>

<p>“<em>Thirdly</em>&mdash;The most important state papers
and documents relating to or coming from our
government.</p>

<p>“<em>Fourthly</em>&mdash;Well-written essays, either original
or extracted, on political, moral and scientific
subjects, and relating to the topography and
geography of our country.</p>

<p>“<em>Fifthly</em>&mdash;A view of the proceedings of our
state and national legislatures, and a strict examination
of the laws passed by them.</p>

<p>“<em>Sixthly</em>&mdash;Literary articles which convey <em>instruction</em>
with <em>amusement</em> will find a niche in our
paper. We shall not, however, seek to <em>amuse</em>
unless we can at the same time <em>instruct</em>. To excite
or gratify the public taste for amusement
alone we consider dangerous to our freedom. By
such means Pericles destroyed the liberties of
Athens, and Cæsar of Rome. Modern France,
too, had her Pericles and her Cæsar; she followed
them, and she is now ruing her folly.
Similar must be our fate when we <em>follow after</em> the
siren song of amusement. We will never be the
willing instruments of thus sapping our free institutions.
If our paper can not find a sufficient
support without this, let it go ‘to the tomb of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the Capulets.’ For we will sooner breast the
torrent of public feeling on this subject, though
we are swept by it into the deep bosom of destruction,
than glide upon its surface and trim
our barques to its course.</p>

<p class="ir1">“Renick, Doan &amp; Co.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Although ably edited&mdash;containing interesting,
well-written and well-selected articles, the verdict
was “<em>perpetual suspension</em>.” The inhabitants
of neither town nor country cared to become
“readers of newspapers.” The agrarian element
of society had not extended to business transactions.
The contracted condition of the “circulating
medium” was such that it became absolutely
necessary to ignore every luxury that required
“spot cash;” while state laws made the
credit system so dangerous, honest people kept
as free as possible from financial obligations.
They did not wish to take the risk of seeing their
names posted in public places, stating the time
the indebtedness would be sold by the sheriff at
public outcry to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>And the citizen continued on his even way,
enjoying the chase&mdash;catching wolves and foxes;
and hunting the deer, turkey and squirrel; and
in summer tilling a few acres of corn&mdash;a small
“patch” of flax&mdash;enough potatoes, beans, pumpkins,
and gourds for the use of the family.
The soil produced well, and with but little labor
enough corn could be raised for family meal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to winter the small amount of stock&mdash;the fire-wood
was secured from wind-falls in the “deadening,”
and with a horse and cow, a few sheep,
and a good dog, the “squirrel hunter” became
wonderfully well satisfied with his environment,
and had no desire for change. The amount he
knew of things transpiring in the outside world
was obtained by the word of mouth in the regular
line of communication.</p>

<p>The women carded the wool and hackled the
flax, and spun and wove the same; and from
year to year there were no changes in household
appearances or landed possessions. The “deadening,”
however, was a little larger in area, in
order to keep up the easily-obtained supply of
fire-wood, and to increase the amount of the
natural grasses and green things in summer for
the benefit of the stock.</p>

<p>All domestic animals subsisted on what nature
furnished in the woods during spring and summer,
and each individual owner had an ear-mark
for hogs and cattle recorded at the county-seat,
which gave security against mistakes, and
when animals became lost furnished information
of ownership and acted as a substitute for a
square in the “lost” column of some newspaper.
It must be remembered that Ohio was not settled
all over at once. It came into the Union an immense
wilderness, and much of it remained unoccupied
for long periods. The first tree cut, in Hardin
county, was cut for bees in 1837&mdash;a dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
black-walnut, seventy-two feet to the first limb.
And as the counties became organized and settled
the inhabitants all commenced at the same
point&mdash;the same style of cabin and like simplicity&mdash;benches
were used for chairs, earth for flooring
and carpet, forked sticks driven into the
ground with cross poles for bedsteads, clap-boards
for bed-cords, and pond-grass for feathers, a
single pot and frying-pan, with a few pewter
dishes, constituted the primitive outfit, sooner or
later, for every county in the state.</p>

<p>The immigrants who pushed forward into the
interior counties suffered most for want of mills
and from the high price of freight, and merchandise,
as salt, flour, and other necessaries of life,
all came from Chillicothe or Zanesville. Salt
was ten and twelve cents a pound, calico one dollar
a yard, coffee seventy-five cents, and whisky
two dollars a gallon.</p>

<p>High prices ruled in all new settlements long
after they had been reduced in and at the vicinity
of Chillicothe and Zanesville; and which, too, was
only partly owing to exorbitant rates for transportation.
So little and so few were articles purchased,
that pioneer merchants did not enter the
interior counties of the state for many years, and
orders for flour, and salt, and other necessaries,
accompanied by the silver, would be forwarded
generally by the bearer of the order, as no regular
mail or line of transportation was run from
one settlement to another. For want of roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the inconvenience was tolerated, as it did not detract
much from the power of the inhabitants in
every part of the state from living well and living
easy. Still there were a few from isolation
or improvidence suffered hardships and unpleasant
conditions, especially in the interior counties.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1803, Henry Berry, a Welshman,
came to this country to establish a home, and
leaving his wife and smaller children in Philadelphia,
Pa., took his two boys, one nine and the
other eleven years old, and put up a small cabin
in the interior of Delaware county, fifteen miles
from the nearest one of the three families that
constituted the white inhabitants. At this time
the country was full of Indians and wild animals,
and was distant from sources of supplies seventy-five
to one hundred miles. The father was so infatuated
with the country, he hurriedly erected
a small cabin of such timber as he and his boys
could handle; and when covered, but without
floor, chimney, or fire-place, and without daubing
or chinking, he fixed the children a place to
sleep, started back for Philadelphia, hoping to
get the rest of his family West before the cold
weather set in. When he reached Philadelphia
he found his wife dangerously sick with a protracted
fever, and before she was able to travel
Mr. Berry became sick, and winter came on, and
he was unable to return until the June following.</p>

<p>The boys had not been heard from; the winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
had been unusually severe, and they had been
left with but a short amount of provisions, without
a gun, surrounded by Indians and wild beasts,
and were compelled to live upon such animals as
they could capture; and with no fireplace or
chimney they passed a cold winter in that open
cabin. And when the father returned with the
family, he found the boys had cleared enough
ground for a large garden and had vegetables
growing from the seeds they had brought with
them from Wales. Of course the boys suffered
much, but like the one on the burning deck, they
heroically stood their ground regardless of consequence.</p>

<p>But the man who would refuse cornbread and
carry a bushel of wheat seventy-five miles on his
shoulder, to get it ground, is not properly a subject
of pity or sympathy.</p>

<p>Before the state had reached its fortieth anniversary,
almost all parental heads establishing
homes in this country, prior to the opening of
the Erie Canal (1825), could, at the sound of a
dinner horn, call in a large family of well-grown
children, numbering a “baker’s dozen,” more or
less; and oftener than otherwise, without the
loss of a single addition.</p>

<p>The ratio of natural increase of population
was satisfactory, and death rate was small. The
climate was healthful; living simple and easy;
house-keeping uncomplicated and destitute of
style. Rural homes were all alike unostentatious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and early marriages were seldom, if ever,
deferred on account of immaturity or financial
circumstances; and large families became fashionable.
Seldom less than ten, and only occasionally
more than twenty children, were added to
the household.</p>

<p>People may have been poor in accumulated
wealth, but it was not felt or despised. A father
with eight or ten robust sons had a sure foundation
for a hope to see the destruction of the surrounding
forest, cultivation of the soil, and the
transformation of a portion of the wilderness
into fields of waving grain, fruits and flowers.</p>

<p>It is possible, and has been no uncommon
thing for heads of large families to live to see
their great-great-grand-children; for it would
seem true, as in history, longevity and children
are very nearly related. As a rule, large families
are healthy, having inherited a full measure of
vital resistance. Records of centenarians show
that both males and females of those who have
gone into the second century have been nearly all
parents of large families; and read quite similar
to the following: “Alexander Hockaday has just
celebrated his one hundred and twelfth birthday.
His wife, a few years younger, is still living.
They were blessed with twelve children, eleven
of whom are living near the aged couple with their
numerous posterity.”</p>

<p>No doubt the existing conditions of a desirable
new country, and the exemption from avarice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
penury or speculation, with the enjoyment of
that happy state unknown to wealth, want or
war, were favorable to longevity and natural increase.
States of the mind and existing impressions,
like acquired habits, are transmissible as
certainly as that of the resemblance of physical
and moral qualities. And with the pioneer posterity,
much of that strong manifestation of
character and mental endowment was due to the
multiplicity and salutary combinations of causes.
Blood will tell, but in addition to descent, posterity
had all the winning influences of a quiet,
simple and easy mode of living&mdash;pure air, earth
and water, filled with inspiration to greatness
and dispensed by nature to those who delight to
worship within her temple and partake wisdom
from beasts, birds and flowers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">OHIO&mdash;PROFESSIONS: MEDICAL, MINISTERIAL, AND LEGAL.</span></h2>


<p>“The subject of practical education has occupied
the attention of every enlightened nation,
and has ever been one of intense interest to the
reflecting portion of this country. It has been a
universally-received axiom, that the foundations
of a republic must be in the information of its
people.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>In the general desire for knowledge and a
steady advancement in the things pertaining to
civilization the professions were in harmony with
that honesty, simplicity and zeal which constituted
the foundation structures of pioneer society.
The doctor, the clergyman and the lawyer
occupied respectively their inviting fields, and
each became alike interested in the ever new
book of nature, and read aloud the wonders of
the New World. The calling of the physician
was not very remunerative. He seldom refused
to obey a call for reason of the inability to pay.
Still, he had but little to do. It was not fashionable
to send for a doctor and have the <em>temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
taken</em> for every little indisposition. The
people, from instinct or circumstances, had great
faith in <em>Nature</em> as a <em>healer</em>. They discovered that
persons recovered from most all diseases; and
that cool spring water and a little catnip or bone-set
tea served to amuse the patient to a satisfactory
termination quite as well as the visits of
the physician.</p>

<p>And, it would appear, the doctors were generally
honest enough to encourage this reasonable
confidence to so great an extent that the good
physical inheritance required very little medication;
and many pioneer fathers and mothers
reared large families of children without the loss
of a single member, as well as without having a
doctor called for any occasion whatever. And
the rate of mortality remained astonishingly low
until the innovation of “cross-roads” medical
colleges, and proprietary nostrums received the
patronage of the public.</p>

<p>The great danger in a free country of the
learned professions being made up of evil, ignorance
and corruption, gave timely warning to the
medical men of Ohio, who, with the aid of the
legislature, endeavored to protect the growing
community against quacks and mountebanks.</p>

<p>The state was divided into districts of several
counties each, in which censors were appointed
and duly qualified “to faithfully perform and impartially
discharge their duties as censors” in the
examination of the qualification of applicants to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
practice medicine and surgery. A certificate of
qualification from the Board of Censors was insufficient
of itself to entitle the holder to practice,
and required a license from the court of
common pleas, certified by the secretary of the
medical district, and placed on record in the
county in which the applicant proposed to practice
medicine and surgery.</p>

<p>The following forms were used:</p>

<p>Each medical district kept a record of all certificates
and licenses issued within the area designated
for public inspection, that all might
know who were qualified to assume the responsibility.</p>

<p>The censors and members licensed composed a
list of the learned and able men of Ohio. Almost
every one licensed brought with him a certificate
of qualification from state censors of some state
east, which was copied into the records kept by
the censors in Ohio.</p>

<p>These “Diplomas” were quite similar in character
and expression, the following being a fair
sample:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The censors and society of the third district
met semi-annually, alternately at Athens and Marietta,
and the place of meeting was generally at
the residence of some citizen, who volunteered in
advance to entertain the doctors. An applicant
for a certificate or license to practice medicine
was required by law, to file with the Board of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Censors a certificate of good moral character and
a fee of ten dollars.</p>

<p>A diploma from the censors, approved by the
court in the county where the practitioner resided,
entitled the holder to a membership of the
medical society in his district, auxiliary to the
state society. Any member failing to attend a
semi-annual meeting subjected himself to a fine,
notwithstanding many were obliged to ride horseback
more than two hundred miles to make the
round trip. The attendance of these meetings,
as the records show, was good, and the proceedings
compare favorably with those of the present
day.</p>

<p>Among the standing resolutions, members were
“requested to exhibit specimens of indigenous
medicinal plants for inspection,” and “Dr. S. B.
Hildreth to procure and keep on hand at all
times genuine vaccine matter, and to furnish the
same to members of the society on their application
and payment therefor.”</p>

<p>At one of these semi-annual meetings the following
met unanimous favor, viz:</p>

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That each individual member of this
society, at the next meeting, furnish in writing
an account of such remedies as are known and
used by the people in their several vicinities,
not hitherto generally employed by the faculty.”</p>

<p>The import of this resolution was of much
more significance than it would seem at the present
time. Then, domestic medicine, or use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
indigenous plants, by a poor and sparsely inhabited
country, was general for diseases incident to
locality. And to receive written statements on
the subject from various parts, covering a large
portion of a great state, by men of science, constituted
an instructive record in diseases, remedies
and results.</p>

<p>Another resolution seems to have been adopted
as the rule of the society, “to report all accidents
requiring surgical interference.” This may have
been from the fact there has always remained a
suspicion of the dual character of things coming
under the law of accidents, and from which
probably originated the saying that “trouble
never comes singly.” This dual character of odd
occurrences has been noticed, and noted more
frequently by physicians and surgeons, perhaps,
than by those of any other calling.</p>

<p>This may not have been uppermost in the mind
of the Doctor when he announced to the society that
he wished to report two unusual cases of “<em>stuck
balls</em>” that came under his notice at the same
time, happening to two squirrel hunters in the
same neighborhood. A young man after squirrels,
became confused in regard to the order in
which the loading materials should be used, and
put the ball down first. The ramrod, however,
was provided with a remedy for such loss of
memory, and the screw in the end of the rod
was firmly fixed in the body of the ball; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
no adequate force seemed at hand to withdraw
the ramrod, as the end projecting beyond the
muzzle was so short the operator was obliged to
apply force by means of the teeth. After making
many unsuccessful efforts a happy thought
seemed born with the necessity, and he felt assured
if he had the ball once started it could
be withdrawn. On this theory he worked just
enough powder in at the “<em>touch-hole</em>” of the
“<em>priming-pan</em>,” as he judged, to give the ball
a slight impetus in the right direction. And
with the end of the ramrod between the teeth,
and great toe upon the trigger, applied full
force, adding that of the powder by means of
the toe, which, to his surprise, lost the ramrod
and left an ugly looking hole in the neck at
the base of the skull. Treatment for gunshot
wound&mdash;recovered.</p>

<p>The other “stuck ball” was caused by a lad
of German extraction failing to close the “priming
pan” to his flint-lock before loading, and consequently
the powder nearly all went out at the
“touch hole” as the ball was pushed down the
barrel. Enough, however, remained with the
“priming” to drive the ball about half way out.
At this point it remained fixed, and the amateur
gunner could neither get it out nor push it down.</p>

<p>Like a dutiful son, reverencing parental wisdom,
returned to the house with the gun, and gave
a statement of the facts. After being equally unsuccessful
in the removal of the obstruction, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
father looked carefully over the make of the gun,
and said, in bad English: “Shon, oh, Shon! did
you cshoot de gunne mid a zingle drigger ur
mid de double drigger?” John replied that it
was shot with a single trigger, which so enraged
the father that he disremembered the commandments,
and with irreligious prefixes declared
any fool might know, to shoot a double-triggered
gun “mid a zingle drigger, the ball would go
only half way out.” The case was considered
hopeless.</p>

<p>These short reports bear the only appearances
of matter for levity that the writer has found in
looking over volumes of manuscript proceedings
of the biennial meetings.</p>

<p>At a subsequent meeting of the Medical Society,
in 1819, an accident is given, as stated,
“not for the surgery there was in it, a simple
fracture of the left clavicle, but on account of
the odd manner in which it occurred and the instructive
sequel. The patient was but recently
from New York City, an estimable young man,
but not versed in the ways of the Western
world,” ... “A squirrel he killed lodged
in another tree on its way to the ground. The
branch that held the unfortunate animal was an
offshoot of an ancient sycamore which had in
some past age of the world been broken off
about thirty feet from the ground; but, like
most sycamores, it was not willing to give up
the ghost, and threw out incipient branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
along the remaining section of the trunk; and
at the top or point of fracture a crown of short
limbs adorned the mammoth stump. It was one
of these top branches that held the squirrel.</p>

<p>“After failing to dislodge the animal by the
usual methods, he went up the tree, and on
the top of the stump he found a good place to
stand and bring the game in reach above his
head. In the act, the decayed wood on which
his feet were placed gave way and let the hunter
down to the base, in a dark tube, six feet in diameter,
without door or window, and no possibility
of returning by the opening he entered.</p>

<p>“As soon as he recovered from the shock, and
took in the situation, he began making voice
signals of distress; but the caliber of the horn
of his dilemma was too large and long to be
blown effectually by an excited and injured asthmatic.
He did, however, the best he could,
thinking if those on earth could not answer his
prayers, ample facilities had been obtained for
being heard <em>from above</em>.</p>

<p>“Fortunately a fisherman had not proceeded
far up the river before he heard groans of distress,
that seemed to come from the water beneath
his boat, and badly frightened, pulled ashore.
Still the muffled cries of human distress were
unceasing, and apparently in all directions among
the trees&mdash;soon a man was located imprisoned in
the interior of a sycamore. Friends were notified,
axes procured and the hunter relieved, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
gave many thanks, requesting that nothing be
said about it.</p>

<p>“He soon recovered from the injury and to
show there is no disposition in the human mind
so universal as that which ‘locks the stable door
after the horse is stolen,’ long after, his friends
smiled but said nothing, as they looked upon
a hatchet suspended to his hunting belt.” And
circumstances make it highly probable that no
one connected with those meeting with the accidents
named, were in any way related to the enrolled
men of renown, known in history as the
“Squirrel Hunters of Ohio;” all are not Jews
that dwell in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Doctors were mostly hunters, consequently the
hunter was not necessarily an ignorant man,
still, in a population of many thousands, the exceptions
might have appeared quite numerous. As
a rule he became a man of extensive information,
and hunted, not as a primitive Darwin-tailed
quadruped “making a struggle for life with a
club,” yet it was to supply the necessities of existence
all the same. Subsistence was, however,
easily obtained, and did not tax much of his
time, and he had abundance of leisure to devote
to experiment and observation. He was a worker
in the vineyard, with the naturalist, geologist,
botanist, biologist, archæologist, etc., and the
aggregate co-operative labor accomplished became
manifestly incalculably great. With object
lessons daily before him, in due time he became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
familiar with the habits, instincts, intelligence
and peculiarities of beasts, birds and insects, as well
as acquainted with the geology, mineralogy and
botany of the district in which he resided. Nothing
escaped observation, from a spear of anemone to
the spreading oaks of the forest. The names
of all beasts, birds, plants and minerals with
characters, habits and qualities could be given
by the accurate and extensive observers and investigators
who were found among resident
squirrel hunters.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Hunter and Dog.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The man with dog and gun could answer
all questions; was the only encyclopedia the
collector had to consult; the formulator of
scientific facts desired no other, could ask for no
better. The Doctor in early days, was a man of
science and literary attainments. And his avocation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
brought him in contact with the hunter
and his valuable collections, observations and investigations,
and in this way became the safety
deposit of facts relating to natural history and
collateral branches; in fact, the medical profession
constituted a small army of zealous collectors
and investigators&mdash;such men as Doctor Ezekiel
Porter, president of the first medical society in
Ohio; Doctors Eliphas Perkins, John Cotton and
Samuel P. Hildreth, of Washington County;
Doctors Ebenezer Bowen, Chancy F. Perkins and
Columbus Bierce, of Athens County; Doctors
Robinson and James S. Hibbard, of Meigs; Doctors
Felix Reignier and J. G. Hamlin, of Gallia;
Doctor Giles S. B. Hempstead, of Scioto; Doctor
Alexander M. Millan, of Morgan; Doctor
Joseph Whipple, of Hocking; Doctor Joseph
Scott, of Madison; Doctor Ezra Chandler, of
Muskingkum; Doctor Jared P. Kirtland, of
Cuyahoga, and others equally well known and
respected in other parts of the country and who
were equally identified with the history of the
state.</p>

<p>To Dr. Samuel P. Hildreth we owe the first
extended and connected account of the geology
of the Ohio Valley. His published notes on the
salt springs and interesting observations on the
coal deposits, with descriptions of the rocks, fossils,
organic remains, illustrated by drawings of
plants and shells, constitutes one of the most
comprehensive documents that has ever been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
made of the geology of the state. And it was
through his influence the legislature took steps
for a geological survey, which was ordered March
27, 1837, with a corps composed of doctors
chiefly&mdash;Professor W. W. Mather, Dr. S. P. Hildreth,
Dr. Jared P. Kirtland, Dr. John Locke,
Dr. C. Briggs, Col. T. W. Foster, and Col. Charles

<p>Dr. Kirtland was a model specimen of those
noble men with great hearts, clear heads and diligent
hands. He was no closet naturalist, but a
student of nature in its full degree. In 1829,
while studying the unios or fresh-water mussels,
he discovered that authors and teachers of conchology
had made nearly double the number of
species which are warrantable. Names had been
given to species in which was only a difference of
form due to males and females of the same species.
The fraternity of naturalists in the United
States and Europe were astonished because of
the value of the discovery and the <em>source whence it
came</em>. There were hundreds and probably thousands
of professors who had observed the unios
and enjoyed the pleasure of inventing new names
for the varieties. “A practicing physician in the
backwoods of Ohio had shattered the entire nomenclature
of the naiads.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>At the Cincinnati meeting of the American
Association in 1852, Professor Kirtland produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
specimens of unios of both sexes, from their
conception through all stages to the perfect animal
and its shell. Agassiz was present and sustained
his views, and said they were likewise
sustained by the most eminent naturalists of
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And it is worthy of remembrance that
it is only those who base their conclusions on observed
nature that make permanent reputations,
and show that theory and discussion do not settle
any thing worthy a place in science.</p>

<p>The field was long and wide as it was inviting
to the man of science. And the large corps of
medical men dispersed over the state, working in
concert with each other, and in daily contact with
the observing hunter, constituted an academy of
science that will not likely ever find its parallel
in enthusiasm, character and efficiency. The
country was so healthy that the practice of medicine
was limited and unremunerative, and the
doctor who carried a gun and whistle for a dog
often had much of his time and attention taken
up with things other than squirrels. He conversed
with intelligent hunters, and listened attentively
to all they had to say, and then investigated their
statements of every thing in turn, from the habits
and life of the black ant, that relieves the beasts
and birds from annoying ticks, up to the most
perplexing questions in natural history. His
shelves were loaded with mineral and archæological
specimens; his cases glistened with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
bright plumage of rare taxidermic birds; his
drawers filled with oological information; and
every rare plant, tree and shrub accurately
drawn and classified, with the fruits and flowers
indigenous to different parts of the state, received
attention and preservation.</p>

<p>And the question may be suggested, Where did
all this wealth of thought and investigation,
scattered over the state, go to?</p>

<p>The answer is found in the collections of
nearly every natural history society in the United
States&mdash;in the geological surveys of the state,
and in the everlasting records made by Thomas
Nuttall, John J. Audubon and Alexander Wilson.
These noted authors with pens, pencils and
brushes were in the new world collecting facts&mdash;each
independent of the other. Nuttall, to make
a compendious and scientific treatise on ornithology,
hoping to produce it at a price so reasonable
as to permit it to find a place in the hands
of general readers. Audubon marked out his
designs on a much larger and more expensive
scale&mdash;to give the exact size, coloring, etc., of
the birds and botany indigenous to the country.
This required double elephantine sheets, three
feet three inches long, by two feet two inches
wide, to accommodate figures of the large birds.
Exactness was a prominent feature in making this
descriptive history. The eye was never trusted
for size; every portion of each object&mdash;the bill,
the feet, the legs, the claws, the very feathers as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
they projected beyond each other, were accurately
measured. These full-size drawings were engraved
and artistically colored by hand, according
to the pattern drawings and colorings made
by the author’s pencil and brush. Collecting
and formulating the material for the four hundred
plates, required six year’s labor in the unbroken
forests, and the publication handicraft
twenty more in a foreign country. It was nevertheless
completed and will forever remain as pronounced,
by the immortal Cuvier, “<em>The greatest
monument ever erected by Art to Nature</em>.”</p>

<p>Alexander Wilson also contemplated nature,
as nature is, and communed with her in her
sanctuaries. In the forests, mountains and
shores, he sought knowledge at the fountain
head.</p>

<p>The observations and records made by these
collectors are the corner stones of natural history
of the United States, and their writings and illustrations
will be consulted when other books
on the subject have passed to oblivion. Still
it can not be claimed that all valuable observations
have been or ever will be registered;
nor that collectors did not obtain much of their
vast stores of information from pioneer residents,
as the acknowledgment of this fact is so often
met with in their works. These authors compliment
the medical profession, who in turn refer
to the pioneers, students and professors in natural
history&mdash;the “Squirrel Hunters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Coues, the standard authority on ornithology
of the present time, was told incidentally by
a reputable woodsman, that the “wild goose” often
nested in trees along large water-courses. The
Doctor could scarcely believe it, and was led to
investigate, and found the circumstance to be a
matter of common information among the residents
of localities where the bird rears its young.
Captain Bindere, of the army, stationed in Oregon,
states that one year it was dry and the
geese all nested on the ground; and the next
year proved wet with high waters, and many
nested in the trees, and asks if this is instinct or
reason. Other birds that usually nest on the
ground, for some reason during the wet season,
occasionally build in trees, showing an architectural
ability entirely different from nests constructed
on the ground. The writer has known
the chewink, or ground-robin to build five feet
from the ground a well-constructed nest, during
wet seasons only.</p>

<p>It is the observing man who resides for many
years among beasts and birds that obtains full
knowledge of their habits under various circumstances.
It is the patient man to whom nature
reveals her secrets; and the half-clad hunter is
often a man versed in these hidden things, and
can even tell how to “feed tadpoles to make them
all females” as correctly as a Professor Drummond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the knowledge of such men have come
the great educators&mdash;the natural history societies
and associations of the north-west. Is there
one of these institutions of civilization that owes
not its origin to the collections, accomplishments,
observations and will of the Squirrel Hunter?
Not one. He not only collected scientific matter,
but was also the man the future looked upon as
the one to open up farms, build school-houses,
churches, highways, water-courses, mills, manufactures&mdash;to
carry on commerce, make laws and
to enforce them. He kept his gun clean, his
powder dry and bullet pouch full, ready to put
down rebellion or subdue invasion, or perform
any other duty assigned him.</p>

<p>All this is no fancy sketch nor pen-picture&mdash;history
written and unwritten will forever stand
with his honorable mention. In the war of
1812, Ohio sent out more of these men as volunteers
than she had voters; and in addition to
this&mdash;when it was known General Hull had disgracefully
surrendered the fort at Detroit, the
Squirrel Hunters in the northern counties of the
state did not await an invitation, but with their
own guns, ammunition, blankets and rations
marched to Cleveland, and made General Brock
and his Indians feel satisfied to have the big
pond of water between them and these determined
men.</p>

<p>The following year (1813), at the time Fort
Meigs was under hot fire and siege by General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Proctor and his mixed army of British and Indians,
the besieging general, it is said, was informed
“ten thousand ‘squirrel hunters,’ called
‘<em>Hardy Buckeyes</em>,’<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> were on their way and near
at hand to tell his army to get out of the country
without delay!” On receipt of this, “not
another gun was fired,” and the general with
his army took the nearest and most expeditious
route to Canada.</p>

<p>In the absence of the love of gain that comes
with higher civilization, the pioneers were in
favorable condition to receive literary and religious
instructions. And the teachers found the
people always as ready and anxious to hear the
words of inspiration and eternal life as are those
of the present time to learn the last quotations
of the market.</p>

<p>The strictly moral and religious elements seldom,
if ever, took part in such amusements as
“shooting-matches,” “horse-racing,” ball-dancing,
card-playing, or drinking whisky. And for
the first forty years of the Nineteenth Century,
the social condition, in regard to loading vices,
had perhaps less evil than at any period since.</p>

<p>The majority of resident citizens were a Sunday-observing,
church-going people. Although
the inhabitants were sparse, the congregations
were generally very large&mdash;whole families would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
walk six, eight, and ten miles or more to hear a Lorenzo
Dow, Jacob Young, or Bishop McKendree.</p>

<p>Sectarian influences were but little felt. The
people encouraged all denominations, though differing
in confessions of faith and church discipline;
each had in view the making mankind
better here, and happier hereafter. “And for
forms of faith, let graceless zealots fight, holding
that his ‘can’t be wrong’ whose life is right.”
And with a people who had many reasons to believe
in special providences it was but consistent
they should cultivate a submissive sincerity and
desire to follow the paths of rectitude, with
faith and assurance&mdash;“to such all ends well.”</p>

<p>In looking back upon the records made by
Squirrel Hunters in early days there may be seen
a most wonderful faith in the providences of practical
religion&mdash;that religion which stays with the
individual throughout his daily occupations of
life. A simple instance of this old-fashioned
piety is sufficient to illustrate its meaning and
spirit of the times, taken from the biography of
one born in the Quaker Church, written by himself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I owned two hundred acres of choice land,
heavily timbered and well watered with springs
and brooks. Of this, only five acres were cleared
for cultivation. My family consisted of wife and
two small children. Of domestic animals, I had
two horses, a cow and a dog. One evening, in the
spring of 1813, the cow failed to come home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Her pasture was an unfenced wilderness. The
bell could not be heard, and search beyond
its sounds was impractical after night. Three
days were ineffectually spent without obtaining
the least clue to her location; and bodings of bad
luck seemed standing in the high way to prosperity.</p>

<div id="Ref_128" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_128.jpg" width="600" height="404" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Man of Special Providences.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“I gave the cow up for lost and resumed the
work of grubbing and burning brush to enlarge
the five acres a little. In the afternoon, while
busily engaged with my thoughts in smoke
and brush, my wife and two children appeared
on the ground. She came to tell me there was
a man at the house with a sad story. He had
been burned out, and lost everything, and wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
help to start again. I told her we were too poor
to help any body; that the half dollar in the
house was all the money we had, and I did not
think it best to part with the last cent; that he
should go to work and earn something and not
spend his time begging of people who have nothing.
My good nature had got around on the
north side.</p>

<p>“As my wife turned toward the cabin, she observed,
‘The man looks much distressed.’ And
either her words, spirit, or something else, brought
before my eyes in large capital letters the creed
or motto of my life, ‘Do right and all will come
right.’ And I called her, saying, ‘Give the unfortunate
man the half dollar, and tell him we
feel for him.’ The beggar left rejoicing. And
while at supper the sound of the cow-bell was at
the door&mdash;the lost had returned, and we were all
happy again.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Pioneer preaching was most satisfactory and
successful, and piety appeared quite as lasting
in members of the Methodist Church as those in
churches holding “once in grace, always in
grace.” It was remarkable, as stated, that in a
sparsely settled country congregations would
assemble in numbers so great no house could
accommodate more than a small fraction of the
multitude. And out-door preaching became a
necessity; and camp-meetings held in “God’s
first temples” were inaugurated in the very commencement
of the settlements, and a meeting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the kind in the pleasant season of the year would
bring together the inhabitants from a large area
of country. And under the supervision of such
eminently spiritual divines as Bishop Asbury,
McKendree, and others, it was not strange the
old lady entertained the opinion that “dogfennel
and Methodism were bound to take the
country.”</p>

<p>Methodism and its methods were better adapted
to the religious wants of the people than any of
the many sects that found missionary encouragement
in the North-west, and it was well said by
Warren Miller, of New York, recently, at the
Methodist Social Union, held in Chicago in
honor of John Wesley&mdash;“that Methodism has
exercised a greater influence for good over the
institutions of our government, from its origin,
and over the lives and character of the masses of
our people than any other branch of the Christian
Church, can not be questioned by any one
who has carefully studied the inner history of
our government and of our people.”</p>

<p>Religious and educational interests were not
neglected, and where the population was too
sparse and poor to afford a week-day school,
children were taught to read and write in Sunday-schools,
which were open in summer in most
every neighborhood. Church buildings were few,
but preaching and religious services were seldom
overlooked, and in warm weather were held in
the groves, and in winter in private houses, bar-rooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
country taverns, school-houses, courtrooms,
and other places obtained for the occasion.
Protracted, tented, or camp-meetings increased,
following the settlements, and becoming
very popular with preachers and people&mdash;usually
lasting over a week&mdash;attended by large congregations
and great revivals.</p>

<p>Stated preaching places were free to all denominations.</p>

<div id="Ref_131" class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="500" height="203" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Church, Residence, and Court-house.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of the numerous log-cabins used for this purpose,
only a few have been preserved as familiar
objects in the history of early settlements. A
house that served as a family residence, hotel,
church, court-house, and school-house&mdash;a humble
log cabin, of which the above drawing is a
faithful likeness&mdash;is still standing.</p>

<p>Dwellings, school-houses, churches, “meeting-houses,”
hotels, and court-houses, resembled each
other so closely, it required a knowledge of the
purpose to apply the correct name. And quite
frequently cabins were dedicated for general purposes,
but without change of pattern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The Methodist Western Conference comprised
in 1802, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee,
Mississippi, and missionary fields in Indiana,
Illinois and Michigan. The ministry traveled on
horseback, and after conference each member
would have his field of labor designated on a
map or drawing. On arrival at point of duty
the minister arranged his own circuit and engaged
his own preaching places, so he might
travel and preach each day in the week.</p>

<p>Bishop Asbury devoted all his time and talents
to this large field of religious instruction; traveled
and preached, and was so devoted to the
religious or spiritual welfare of the people that
he often remarked to Mr. Kendree that his work
was so arduous that he “never had time to
marry a wife, buy a farm or build a house.”
And it can not be said that he or those in his
charge had either an easy or lucrative calling&mdash;the
bishop’s salary being sixteen dollars per quarter,
or sixty-four dollars per annum. But he
lived to see that for which he and other Christian
denominations labored&mdash;ten years of the most
remarkable revivals of religion that ever occurred
in the United States, and of which Ohio
and the North-west received a full share of the
good and lasting results.</p>

<p>In the period from 1800 to 1810, or during the
height of the great religious revival that swept
over the western and southern states, there existed
a singular manifestation, called the “<em>jerks</em>.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
It appeared to follow and to be in some way related
to religious excitement; to be no respecter
of persons, and made victims of all classes
and conditions of society. A noted divine in
his autobiography says: “I have often seen
the ladies take it at the breakfast table, as they
were pouring out tea or coffee. They would
throw the whole up toward the ceiling, and
sometimes break both cup and saucer. They
would then leave the table in great haste, their
long suits of braided hair hanging down their
backs, at times cracking like a whip. For a
time it was the topic of conversation, public and
private, both in and out of the church. Various
opinions prevailed. Some said it was the work
of the devil, and strove against it. Sometimes
it almost took their lives.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The Methodist and Presbyterian ministers were
working together in the revival very harmoniously.
But in due time it became whispered
around that the Methodists were making more
noise than necessary; that shouting was a matter
under the control of the will, and should be
moderated. All this reached the ears of a young
minister, who, at a camp-meeting in 1804, and before
an audience of more than ten thousand people,
concluded it a fitting moment to set matters
right and explain or give the philosophy of the
“<em>jerks</em>,” and that of shouting, and of which he
says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“On Monday morning I preached. I was preceded
by the venerable Van Pelt, who, having
preached a short and pithy sermon, sat down,
with the congregation bathed in tears. There
was no appearance of jerks. I took the stand
like most of men who know but little and fear
nothing, and undertook to account for the
jerks. The preachers behind me looked as if
they were alarmed, the audience seemed astonished
at the young man. I viewed it as a judgment
on that wicked community. This led me to
take a compendious view of nations, to show
that God’s providence was just, as well as merciful.
Though He bore long, His judgments were
sure to come.... I took occasion to dwell
on the rise and progress of Methodism in this
country, and the cruel persecutions its professors
had met from their neighbors. I quoted their
taunting language: ‘How, the Methodists are a
pack of hypocrites, and could refrain from shouting
if they would.’ I made a pause, then exclaimed,
at the top of my voice: ‘<em>Do you leave off
jerking if you can?</em>’ It was thought more than
five hundred commenced jumping, shouting, and
jerking. There was no more preaching that day.
One good old mother in Israel admonished me,
and said I had just done it in order to set them
to jerking.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The “jerks” have never been satisfactorily accounted
for. Some persons have attributed the
manifestations to the influence of witchcraft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
But this superstition failed to fasten itself upon
Western civilization as it unfortunately did on
the Eastern States; and the witches imported
into the North-west were so few and insignificant
in character that none of the tribe ever reached
recognition to an extent sufficient to obtain more
than a mere mention in the statute books of
Ohio. They made but little public history.</p>

<p>In 1828, there was a court case in Lawrence
county, involving the individuality of those
operating the “black art,” growing out of an action
to recover on a warranty given in a bill of sale
of a horse. The horse proved unsatisfactory, if not
unsound. And it was claimed the horse was
docile and all right, excepting for frequent periodical
“spells,” in which he would stop in the
midst of routine work, and, after a short pause,
would rear, kick, plunge, and strike out right
and left, uttering unearthly cries, foaming at the
mouth, and trembling, showing great fatigue and
fear. All these alarming symptoms would pass
off in a short time, and the animal would again
resume its normal condition and in all respects
a docile and well educated beast.</p>

<p>It was during one of the animal’s normal periods
that the defendant sold it to the plaintiff, making
the usual warranty. Soon after, while the animal
was quietly drawing the family to a country
church, he commenced kicking and screaming,
until he demolished a new wagon and tore down
the “worm fences” in the vicinity of the transaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and suit was brought upon the warranty
to recover the money.</p>

<p>The witnesses for plaintiff showed conclusively
that there was something wrong with the horse;
and defendant frankly admitted all that had
been testified as to the singular “spells” or waywardness
of the animal, and related others more
startling, but declared that this was not because
of any unsoundness, but owing to the horse being
bewitched from time to time by a gang of
witches under control of an old lady who lived
in seclusion of the mountains and fastnesses for
which Lawrence county is noted.</p>

<p>The defendant stated to the court that this
gang were in the habit of taking possession of
horses and cattle, and sometimes of men and
women, riding and worrying them almost to
death in the night-time. That the horse he
had sold (and causing this suit) was one of
the victims of this witchery, and that he sold
the horse to his neighbor hoping the evil spirit
would not pursue it when it had passed into other
hands&mdash;adding, “If witches could be driven out
of the neighborhood <em>the horse would be all right</em>,
and the people would be better off.”</p>

<p>Upon mature deliberation, the court went far
enough in the direction of the views of the defendant
to render a conditional judgment, to wit,
“that the defendant should either repay the
plaintiff the price of the horse, or relieve the animal
of the witches.” Upon receipt of this optional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
decree, the defendant went up to the head
waters of Little Beaver, in Pike county, and consulted
a noted witch doctor who resided in that
neighborhood.</p>

<p>After obtaining a statement of the case, the
doctor concluded it was necessary to visit the locality
and make a careful and mysterious study
of the situation. On arrival in the affected district
the doctor soon discovered that the old
woman on the hill was at the head of a gang of
witches, and prescribed an old-time remedy&mdash;that
she be at once seized and burned at the stake.</p>

<p>It is reported that even the victims of the
witches thought this to be rather heroic, and insisted
that some milder remedy should be adopted.
After several days study of the case, the doctor
so far modified the prescription as to substitute
the first animal that fell into the clutches of the
witches as a vicarious offering at the stake.</p>

<p>“It was only a few days until one of the defendants’
cows was taken possession of by a battallion
of witches, which apparently showed
indications of complete recovery. Defendant
lost no time, but called his neighbors together to
assist him in tying the cow with ropes and leading
her into a neighboring clearing, where there
were plenty of dry logs and brush.</p>

<p>“These were piled around and over the
bellowing animal and fired. Then began a
supernatural battle. The cow refused to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
burned to death and gave vent to the most piteous
and unearthly moans. More brush and logs
were piled on her, and blue flames leaped high
in the air, assuming grotesque shapes and uttering
guttural laughing sounds.</p>

<p>“As sunset approached, the struggles and
moans of the animal began to subside and the
flesh and bones began to yield to the consuming
fangs of the flame; the doctor and the defendant
in the law-suit, stood by watching for the denouement
with absorbing interest, while the awe-stricken
neighbors stood farther back in the
gathering folds of the approaching night.</p>

<p>“There was a lurid outburst of flames, demoniac
cries and gibbering as a cloud of sparks
rose upward, on the crest of which were a score
of witches, each with a firebrand in its hand.
Up and up they rose, then sailed away over the
hill and past the hut of the old lady, and finally
disappeared from sight.”</p>

<p>The bewitched horse recovered his wonted
docility, and the purchaser never again had any
complaint to make. The old lady ceased to
commune with witches, joined the church, and
when she passed away was mourned by the entire
community, and so far as known, the witch
doctor never had another case, and the court
records officially attest that there once were
witches in this part of Ohio, but were most effectually
expelled by fire and the doctor, and
fled shrieking across the Ohio River, into Kentucky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
where they still exist among white
politicians and the aged colored population, who
once served under the previous condition. All
of which is a pointer as to variety, or that Ohio
can show enough merely to make up a fair assortment
and pattern of most every kind of
people, with room for improvement by further
advances in civilization that will end the least
barbarous act in the attempt to diminish crime by
the horrors of electrocution, the rope, or the
stake and fagots.</p>

<p>But the “jerks,” as well as witchcraft, soon
gave way before the ministers of the gospel, who
were a social body of men, welcomed always at
pioneer homes: although many stories have been
circulated in regard to their love for barn-yard
poultry. In early days wild game was common,
and when a preacher called, something extra was
sought in honor of the guest, and generally a
chicken was sacrificed for the occasion. At one
time, the minister who said “a turkey was an
unhandy bird&mdash;rather too much for one, and not
quite enough for two,” called to dine with a
widow woman and sister in the church, who was
noted for her willingness to put the “best foot
foremost.” After a short time the clergyman went
out to look after his horse, and heard a boy crying,
and soon located him back of the corn-crib,
with a chicken under his arm. “What is the
matter, sonny?” said the divine in his most
soothing manner. The boy bawled out “Matter!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
between the hawks and circuit-riders, this is
the only chicken left on the place.”</p>

<p>Early in the nineteenth century a citizen and
observing author<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> says: “There is a prejudice
against all preachers in this (Ohio) and all other
states is certainly true; but, so far as we are
acquainted with them, and we know them well,
we are compelled to say that our clergymen in
Ohio, especially those who have lived here ever
since our first settlement, deserve unqualified
praise for their zeal and good works. <em>No men in
this state</em> have been <em>so useful in building up society,
in making us a moral and truly religious people</em>.</p>

<p>“Their disinterestedness and benevolence; their
kindness, forbearance and charity, zeal, industry
and perseverance in well-doing, merit and receive
the respect, gratitude and affection of all good
men. They have labored zealously and faithfully
and long, and their pay has been but
trifling. We name them not, though we know
them all. They have always been the true
friends of liberty, and they would be the very
last men in the nation to wish to overturn our
free institutions.”</p>

<p>The work of the clergy, though differing from
that of the doctor, often caused them to meet on
common ground, and they were alike fast friends
of humanity and of each other. As a financial
success neither could boast the superior; but in
the good works in which they were engaged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
minister of the gospel held the longer and
stronger lever. With the doctor “death ended
all;” but the lessons of the man of inspiration
established a faith in a higher and everlasting
existence, which shed its influence from
the departed to the living, and placed in view
another and higher kingdom.</p>

<p>For many years the learned profession of law
was a mere form, and practically remained on
the statute books. Few indeed were the causes
justifying legal investigation. Parties having
grievances preferred to settle them in the primitive
way.</p>

<p>A single recorded instance so fully represents
the infant scales of justice in Ohio that we quote
the proceedings of the first court held in Greene
county, in a public “tavern” with all the accommodations
for man and beast.</p>

<p>The first court-house in this county was not located
within the area of the present city of
Xenia, and it was by no means as pretentious as
the present structure. A primitive log cabin
with a single room, in a “clearing” of a few
acres, some five miles west of the present county
seat, a little off the road which leads from Xenia
to Dayton, with Owen Davis’s mill on one side
and a block-house on the other side of the stream,
was the place where the blind goddess first set up
her balances.</p>

<p>The building was constructed by General Benj.
Whiteman more than a century ago, and shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
after became the property of Peter Borders, and
was selected by the “court” as the seat of justice
in 1803, when the first session was held to complete
the county organization. The first term of
court was synonymous with a meeting of the
county commissioners of the present day. The
presiding, or law, judge, Hon. Francis Dunlavy,
was not present, and the associate judges, William
Maxwell, Benjamin Whitman and James
Barrett, with John Paul, clerk, met at the Borders
cabin on the 10th of May, 1803, and duly
dedicated it. The session lasted but a single day,
and the business dispatched was the organization
of the townships. This done, the court adjourned
until the next regular session, which convened
some two months later.</p>

<p>This was a more imposing court and was convened
for trying such causes, civil and criminal,
as might come up for consideration. The court
opened with a perfect, clean docket, and for a
short time it looked as though there would be
nothing to do. Judge Francis Dunlavy, then
one of the most distinguished citizens of the new
state, and who had served in the territorial legislature,
from Hamilton county, presided, with
associate justices Maxwell, Whiteman and Barrett
on the bench, and Daniel Symmes, of Hamilton,
performing the duties of prosecuting attorney.
The grand jury was composed of William J.
Stewart, foreman, John Wilson, Wm. Buckles,
Abram Van Eaton, James Snodgrass, John Judy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Evan Morgan, Robert Marshall, Alex. C. Armstrong,
Joseph Wilson, Joseph C. Vance, John
Buckingham, Martin Mindenhall and Henry
Martin, who were duly sworn and impaneled.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Dunlavy (as recorded) delivered
a forcible charge to the grand jury, directing it
to diligently inquire into and make a true presentment
of all infractions of the law within its
bailiwick. Duly impressed with the solemnity
of the charge to which they had listened, the
jury retired a few yards distant from the cabin,
where they began the first grand inquest, but
the most diligent inquiry failed to discover a
single case requiring their attention and action.</p>

<p>The court, as it seems, would have proved an
absolute and inglorious failure had not Owen
Davis, the miller, come to its rescue. People far
away as the Dutch settlement in Miami, had
taken advantage of court day to come to the mill
with their grists. Among the number from a
distance was a Mr. Smith from Warren county.
Mr. Smith had the reputation of helping himself
to pork wherever he could find wild hogs in the
woods, and Mr. Davis, after having turned out
the grist for his Warren county friend, concluded to
administer a little “pioneer law” on his own account,
while the court was proceeding in a more
conventional manner. Accordingly he gave the
unfortunate Smith a good drubbing, and as he
was an expert Indian fighter, the job, no doubt,
was well done. Having finished it, he burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
into the primitive courtroom where the judges
sat around the deal table in solemn state and
awful dignity, with the exclamation&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be blanked if I haven’t done it!”</p>

<p>“Done what, sir?” inquired associate justice
Whiteman.</p>

<p>“I’ve whipped that blanked hog thief from
down the country, Ben, and I’ve made a good
job of it. What’s the damage, anyhow? What’s
to pay?”</p>

<p>Whereupon he pulled out his purse and counted
down a handful of silver coins, while the court
looked on with horrified surprise, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a fact,” he went on, “I’ve whipped
him, Ben, and blank you if you’d steal a hog,
I’d whip you, too!”</p>

<p>This was altogether too much for the court,
and the sheriff was ordered to go out and get the
witnesses to the affray and take them before the
grand jury. The miller’s pugilistic performance,
however, had proved contagious, and when the
sheriff got outside, he found a free fight going on
in all directions, and the grand jurors watching
it through the openings in the little out-house.</p>

<p>Everybody who had a grievance was settling,
or trying to settle it in the regular way, in backwoods
fashion, and the grand jury and prosecutor
Symmes at once had their hands more than
full of business. A score or more of witnesses
were examined and by the middle of the afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
nine indictments for affray and assault and
battery were presented in court, and the offenders,
including the owner of the court-house, were
arraigned. All plead guilty, beginning with Davis,
the first offender, who was assessed a fine eight
dollars, and the rest four dollars each. All paid
their fines upon the nail, so that the court, owing
to the fortunate visit of the Warren county man,
found itself in funds to the amount of forty dollars
before early candle lighting.</p>

<p>The rest of the business of the court, including
a license to Peter Borders, to conduct a
“tavern” in the court-house, with all the word
implied, for which he was taxed eight dollars,
was finished before bed time, and the court was
ready to adjourn at an early hour next morning.</p>

<p>Daniel Symmes, the prosecuting attorney, had
come from Cincinnati, making the fifty miles’
journey on horseback along the Indian trails, and
the court awarded twenty dollars out of the proceeds
of the fines as compensation. But when it
reassembled in December following, it decided
that the payment had been illegally made, and
Mr. Symmes was required to refund it. This
so discouraged the prosecuting attorney, he decided
that thereafter he would not appear in that
court as prosecutor. He was partially remunerated,
however, when, a few years later, he was
promoted to the supreme bench.</p>

<p>The first session of the Supreme Court was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
hold in this old log-cabin, on the 25th of October,
1803, the judges present being Samuel Huntington
and William Sprigg. The third judge, Jonathan
Meigs, was unable to be present, but Arthur
St. Clair, of Hamilton county, attended the
sitting in all the glory of a cocked hat and other
military paraphernalia. The only business transacted
by the court was to admit Richard Thomas
to the practice of law.</p>

<p>The descendants of pioneers cling with tenacity
to the memories of olden times, and are proud
of the historic struggles made by their ancestors
to establish schools, churches, and good government
in a wilderness known only to savage life
for untold ages. Although there was little cause
for litigation, it was necessary to hold the courts
of justice open, as it was to encourage schools
and churches that directed society in the enlightened
paths of virtue and higher plane of civilization.</p>

<p>Workers in religious denominations met with
more or less encouragement, and mapped out
their fields upon a large scale for future operations.
And fathers and mothers, doctors, ministers,
and lawyers worked harmoniously together
to instruct, educate, and elevate coming generations,
and many lived to witness the fruits of
those exertions with pride and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Colonel Charles Whittlesey, in an address before
the “Northern Ohio Historical Society,” November,
1881, says: “If our representative men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
are prominent, it may be a source of honorable
state pride, for, while great men do not make
a great people, they are signs of a solid constituency.
Native genius is about equally distributed
in all nations, even in barbarous ones; but it
goes to waste wherever the surroundings are not
propitious....</p>

<p>“Cromwell was endowed with a mental capacity
equal to the greatest of men; but he
would not have appeared in history if there had
not been a constituency of Round-heads, full of
strength, determined upon the overthrow of a
licentious king and his nobility....</p>

<p>“Washington would not have been known in
history if the people of the American Colonies
had not been stalwarts in every sense, who selected
him as their representative. In these
colonies the process of cross-breeding among races
had then been carried further than in England,
and is now a prime factor in the strength of the
United States.</p>

<p>“I propose to apply the same rule to the first
settlers of Ohio, and to show that if she now
holds a high place in the nation, it is not an accident,
but can be traced to manifest natural causes,
and those not alone climate, soil, and geographical
position.”</p>

<p>No doubt, the admixture of races has in some
cases added something favorable to the physical
and mental powers of manhood; but, perhaps,
in regard to the superiority of the men of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
North-west, more must be attributed to the
natural conditions and surroundings which secured
freedom from all corroding influences of
avarice, added to the alert outdoor life among
Indians and savage beasts, with the rifle and
attendant athletic exercises, that gave mental
stimulation without subsequent exhaustion of
mind or body. The rising Squirrel Hunter is no
drone; he represents a bundle of activities that
scorns a leisure that breeds an indolent stupidity.</p>

</div>

<p>The facilities for the physical culture were
greatly in advance of those for the development
of the mental; and it is remarkable what the
key to education has in its turn accomplished&mdash;the
Bible, “Buckley’s Apology” and “Pilgrim’s
Progress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the present educational influences were
unknown to the generation that has given to the
United States so many great men. In their
youthful days libraries were exceedingly few, and
books were expensive and not easily obtained;
and little reason had any one to anticipate that
the boys living in the backwoods of Ohio, shooting
squirrels and hoeing corn, spring and summer;
catching rabbits, foxes and coons in the
fall and winter, and occasionally attending a
“subscription school” in some abandoned log
cabin two or three months, would ever become
stars of the first magnitude in the literary canopy
of the United States.</p>

<p>From the Atlantic to the Pacific&mdash;in every city,
in every town&mdash;boys of the rural districts of
Ohio have marched to the front. Even in the
National Metropolis it need not be asked:
“Whence came Murat Halstead, Whitelaw Reid,
John A. Cockerill, Charles J. Chambers, William
H. Smith, Bernard Peters, William L. Brown,
and others.” The New York <cite>Tribune</cite>, <cite>Herald</cite>,
<cite>World</cite>, Associated Press, <cite>Times</cite> and <cite>Daily News</cite>,
and the evidences of success resulting from ability,
integrity and business capacity, give the answer,
“<em>Ohio</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>
<p>Whatever the cause may now be attributable
to, there can be no question of the inherited capacity
and natural and acquired ability which
has enabled the “<em>Squirrel Hunters</em>” of Ohio to
give to the nation greater and more useful men
during the present century than all the other
states combined.</p>

<p>In every channel of advancing civilization the
<em>Ohio man</em> is found over the entire world, and is
known by the stamp he bears&mdash;“none other
genuine”&mdash;“O.I.O.” It may be excusable to
name a few of the many national characters
which an Ohio man is ever proud to recall with
an admiration unknown to egotism&mdash;of such&mdash;Thomas
Ewing, Rufus P. Ranney, George H.
Pendleton, Joseph Medell, Richard Smith, Donn
Piatt, Ed. Cowles, Samuel Medary, W. McLean,
E. D. Mansfield, James G. Birney, Swayne,
Springer, Scoville, Chase, Simpson, McIlvaine,
Thomas Cole, Hiram Powers, Wm. H. Beard,
Quincy Ward; the great inventor, Edison; the
arctic explorer, Dr. Hall; the Siberian traveler,
George Kennon; the astronomer, Mitchell; geologists,
Hildreth, Newberry, and Orton; humorists,
Artemus Ward and Petroleum V. Nasby; as
popular writer, A. W. Tourgee and William Dean
Howells. The latter found “<em>Squirrels</em>” in the
spring, where they resorted for “the sweetness in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the cups of the tulip-tree blossoms;” and in boyhood
made “<em>impressions</em>” with his bare feet in
the snow on the cabin floor, and in after life more
lasting ones with his pen on the hearts of those
who have been favored with his literary productions.</p>

<p>Why was it said on the 4th of March, 1881,
the nation was enabled to see “three men of fine
presence advanced on the platform at the east
portico of the Federal Capitol? On the right, a
solid, square-built man, of impressive appearance,
the Chief-Justice of the United States (Morrison
R. Waite). On his left stood a tall, well-rounded,
large, self-possessed personage, with a head large
even in proportion to the body, who is President
of the United States (James A. Garfield). At
his left hand was an equally tall, robust, and
graceful gentleman, the retiring President (R. B.
Hayes). Near by was a tall, not especially
graceful figure, with the eye of an eagle, who is
the general commanding the army (Wm. Tecumseh
Sherman). A short, square, active officer,
the Marshal Ney of America, Lieutenant-General
(Phil. Sheridan). Another tall, slender, well-poised
man, of not ungraceful presence, was the
focus of many thousand eyes. He had carried
the finances of the nation in his mind and in his
heart, four years as the Secretary of the Treasury,
the peer of Hamilton and Chase (John Sherman).
Of these six five were natives of Ohio,
and the other a life-long resident. Did this group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of national characters from our state stand there
by accident? Was it not the result of a long train
of agencies, which, by force of natural selection,
brought them to the front on that occasion?”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>While this painting from life will ever stand
as a most worthy compliment to Ohio, it must be
looked upon as but a detached part of the great
picture of the North-west, in the center of which
may be seen the full measure of a wise man
crowned with six stars untarnished with slavery&mdash;Nathan
Dane, of Massachusetts, 1787.</p>

<p>The Ohio State Journal says of the 4th of
March, 1897, that, “This is a great time for Ohio
at the National Capital. The Buckeye State is
very much in evidence. The President is from
Ohio; the Secretary of State is from Ohio; Mark
Hanna is an Ohio man; Secretary Alger was born
and bred in Ohio; ... Senator Foraker,
who is expected to be one of the leaders in the
senate, is an Ohio man; the First Assistant Secretary
of State ... is an Ohio man. In
short, Ohio politicians will be in the saddle as far
as national affairs go, and, compared with them,
the Republicans of the other states are small potatoes,
so to speak.</p>

<p>“Ohio has for the last quarter of a century been
a great state for presidents. But it never occupied
a more conspicuous position in the sisterhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of states than to-day. The Ohio man comes very
near being the whole thing.”</p>

<p>Ohio has made her mark politically high, and
still manifests a modest willingness to furnish the
nation with presidents and other high officials,
although the New York World thinks the kissing
of the words of Holy Writ by the last favorite
son assumed a rather extravagant and monarchical
appearance; that it cost only five thousand
dollars to seat Thomas Jefferson, while the ceremonial
bill for William McKinley and the tenth
verse of the first chapter of the Second Chronicles
footed two million five hundred and fifty-five
thousand five hundred dollars; and <em>bannered</em> the
fifteenth verse of the same chapter, for the time
being at least. For with that “<em>wisdom and knowledge</em>,”&mdash;“the
king <em>made</em> silver and gold at Jerusalem
(Washington) as <em>plenteous as stones</em>.”</p>

<p>And in this line, not of boasting, but of greatness,
it is not thought strange, after supplying
the nation with a large ratio of leading
statesmen, artisans, scientists and men of letters,
the state should have had in readiness for the occasion&mdash;one
general, U. S. Grant; one lieutenant-general,
Mr. Tecumseh Sherman; twenty
major and thirty-six brigadier generals; with
twenty seven brevet major-generals and one hundred
and fifty brigadier generals; a secretary of
war, Edwin M. Stanton; a secretary of the treasury,
S. P. Chase; a banker, J. Cooke, with a
contribution of three hundred and forty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
armed men and twenty-six independent batteries
of artillery, and five independent companies
of cavalry.</p>

<p>Ohio had the men&mdash;had the will&mdash;and when
the call came, went into the war to fight, and of
which she did her share, as the eleven thousand
two hundred and ten killed and mortally wounded
on the battle-fields, attest.</p>

<p>The finances were so ably managed by the
secretary and his advisor, Jay Cooke, that a
rebel leader declared the treasury, and not the
war department, had conquered the South. To
take an empty and bankrupt treasury and agree
to find, equip and pay the immense federal army
was the portion assigned to secretary Chase.
And when Mr. Cooke asked the amount required
daily to meet demands&mdash;the reply was “two
millions, five hundred thousand dollars. Can
you raise the money?” “I can,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooke organized a plan for popularizing
the loan, and soon had receipts coming into the
treasury, averaging over four millions per day.
It must be admitted that brains, as well as bullets,
gave strength and success to the federal
forces, and it can be truthfully as well as modestly
assumed, that Ohio furnished her share of both,
with honest scripture measure.</p>

<p>Ohio people are not given much to foolish
pride, although considered sensitive; and those
familiar with the resources, industries, wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and learning, were surprised that the glorious
first-born of the family of the “North-west Territory,”
should come so far short of expectations
at the World’s Columbian Centennial
Exposition, at Chicago. The state was all right,
however, and deeply interested. But political
favoritism and incompetency often supplants meritorious
ability, and determines adversely what
otherwise would claim admiration and give general
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Ex-Governor Campbell, in an address recently,
would mislead a stranger, when he says, “The State
of Ohio was at Atlanta in 1864, under Sherman,
but is not now at Atlanta as part of the great exhibit
of industrial products held there, because,
under, and by virtue of the last general assembly,
the state credit was reduced so low, and its coffers
so depleted, that not money enough could be found
for this purpose. The only official representation
from our state at Atlanta, in the year 1895, is on
the part of a few lady commissioners, who have
the freemen’s privilege of paying their own expenses.”</p>

<p>Does anyone believe Ohio is poverty stricken?
Has anyone known the state or people to be so
since the squirrel hunters traded coon-skins for
books, that it could not turn Lake Erie into the
Ohio River&mdash;the army of the “Southern Confederacy”
face about&mdash;or make a first-class exhibit
in any competitive exposition? As a statement, it
is true, “Ohio is not at Atlanta.” But the absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
is not due to the causes assigned, and the
wonder is, she is as rich and powerful as she is,
after being forced so frequently to play the part
of the individual that journeyed from Jerusalem
down to Jericho.</p>

<p>Ohio is an agricultural state, populated with
those who hold the handles of the plough and
fear not poverty, discontent and strikes. The
native inhabitants inherited a love of liberty and
independence from an ancestry who came to a
wilderness to secure <em>homes</em> for themselves and
posterity. And it was in these <em>homes</em> a permanent
foundation for a superior civilization was laid;
and through the providences of a people with
<em>homes</em> and families, supported by natural and
cultivated resources, that has transformed unbroken
forests into fertile fields and developed an
intelligent, happy and prosperous people.</p>

<p>It is an old and well-founded belief that the
earth was not made in vain, but is capable of
fulfilling all the purposes for which it was created&mdash;now
as at any other period in its history.
It is also worthy of thought that the interest in
the well-being of man by creative and governing
intelligence is not less than that extended to the
beasts of the fields, and that his title to a share
of subsistence on the earth is quite as good as
that of the cattle that graze upon a thousand
hills.</p>

<p>Every one can, and every one should, secure a
share in this inheritance while living. His heirship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
is indisputable, and on which no mortgage
ever found a right, room or reason to rest. If
every cast-off from the seductive trusts, combines
and monopolies&mdash;every one of the millions
begging bread&mdash;had a definite home upon the soil
of the earth, there would be room for millions
more, and bread riots and starvation would be
unknown in all the land.</p>

<p>Natural civilization&mdash;that made in accordance
with the laws of nature&mdash;does not consist in aggregating
the products of labor into the hands of
a few and distributing poverty broadcast to the
many, but in cultivating intelligence, securing
homes, families, subsistence, comfort and happiness,
by every man owning and controlling the
products of his own labor.</p>

<p>During the first half century of the settlement
in the Buckeye State, the equality and advancement
of true civilization of the people have never
been surpassed in the history of the world. Although
their land estates were small, and with
that prohibition nature had thrown around the
state against all foreign imports, it might readily
be imagined the living and populating a great
empire on its own developed resources would
naturally entail much want and distress. But
such was not the fact. They all had enough and
to spare, and vagrants were as unknown to public
provision as were paupers or want among the
sparrows, or the innumerable millions of buffalo
that were provided for on the western plains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who had homes they could call their
own, with families and friends, plenty to supply
the necessities of life, were singularly exempt
from avarice, or that which since the world
began has been denounced “the root of all evil.”</p>

<p>The first organized money power of serious import,
endangering a republican form of government,
was the monopoly termed “The Bank of
the United States,” incorporated by act of Congress
in 1816, for the term of twenty years. And
with its millions of easily earned profits, it soon
controlled legislation in the interests of wealth
and the corporation, causing suffering and disaster
to the business of the nation by making
prices unstable through contractions and expansions
of the mediums of exchange, so that the
State of Ohio raised objections to the contemplated
establishment of branches of the monopoly
within her borders.</p>

<p>After much political discussion of the matter,
a legislature was elected largely opposed to the
money power, and the state in 1818 passed an act
in the nature of a high protective tariff, “taxing
each branch of the United States Bank located
in the State of Ohio fifty thousand dollars.”
The bank refused to pay the assessments when
due under the act, and, like most monopolies in
sight of a supreme court, disregarded the act of
legislation and defied the authorities.</p>

<p>The law-makers in Ohio, even in that early
day, had seen enough to understand the defiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
insubordination of wealth, and in the act for collecting
the tax from the branch banks due the
state, authorized the collector to employ an armed
force, if necessary, and to enter the bank and
seize money sufficient to cover the claim and costs
of collection.</p>

<p>This was done by the collector for the “Chillicothe
branch,” and the state became defendant,
returning with interest the money taken at the
end of the usual course of litigation, by an order
of the supreme court. It has often been related
by those who took part in the great struggle for
supremacy of <em>law</em>, or <em>will of the majority of a producing
population</em>, as against the tyrannical
usurpations of a money power, with its revolving
satellites, that the contest threatened the
peace, prosperity and safety of the whole nation.</p>

<p>As stated by Hon. Brisben Walker, the institution
“quickly became a political power; established
branches and agencies throughout the
country to <em>control votes</em>; spent money freely for
<em>political</em> corruption;” and when it went down, was
reported in 1839, by a committee of its own
stockholders, to have given “<em>such an exhibition of
waste and destruction, and downright plundering and
criminal misconduct, as was never seen before in the
annals of banking</em>.</p>

<p>“<em>Thirty millions of its loans</em> were not of a mercantile
character, but made to <em>members of Congress,
editors of newspapers, politicians, brokers, favorites,
and connections</em>.” And it continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
rule until the will and wisdom of President Jackson
put an end to the great monopoly. He
removed the government deposits, prevented a
re-charter, and in 1833 made a statement to Congress,
giving the grounds on which his action
was based toward the bank, saying “<em>it was for
attempting to control the elections, producing a contraction
of the currency, and causing general distress</em>.”
The funeral went off quietly, with but few
mourners, and the American people were liberated
from the bondage of aggregated wealth, and
Ohio obtained a lease for a number of prosperous
decades. But the war of the Sixties came, and
moneyed combines grew in power and audacity,
until many persons expressed fears for the laws,
labor and liberties of the common people.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the small number of
wealthy persons among the great mass of the
people, it is rather remarkable that so many patriotic
men in this country, from the days of
Washington up to the present time, have expressed
emphatically their fears for the welfare
of the republic should it fall under the destructive
power of concentrated and organized wealth.</p>

<p>President Jackson declared it was “better to
incur any inconvenience that may be reasonably
expected than to <em>concentrate the whole money power
of the republic</em> in any form whatsoever, or under
any restrictions.” He had seen the arrogant influences
under all the restrictions law could give,
and gave the warning statement that what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
saw were but premonitions of the fate that awaits
the American people should they be deluded into
sustaining institutions of “<em>organized wealth</em>.”</p>

<p>President Lincoln said, at the close of the sanguinary
struggle: “It has cost a vast amount of
treasure and blood; ... but I see in the
near future a crisis approaching that unnerves
me and causes me to tremble for the safety of
the country. As the result of war corporations
have been enthroned, and an era of corruption in
high places will follow, and the money power of
the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by
working upon the prejudices of the people, until
all wealth is aggregated into a few hands, and
the republic is destroyed. I feel at this moment
more anxiety for the safety of my country than
ever before, even in the midst of war. God
grant that my suspicion may prove groundless.”</p>

<p>These and other prophetic warnings carry with
them a vast degree of thoughtful solemnity, due
to our knowledge of man and the signs of
the times. When the successful candidate for
office is made to depend upon the size of the
campaign fund, and party success more or less
assured in proportion to the length of figures beyond
a dollar mark, the liberties of the common
people are fraught with danger, if not already
destroyed.</p>

<p>Wherever the corrupting influence of money
has been permitted to enter politics, it has become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
more successful than just and salutary announcements,
and has been used aggregatingly
by the wealthy in amounts sufficient to secure
their own interests, regardless of party lines or
the welfare of the public. This may appear severe
in statement, but it is nevertheless true to
the experience of one who has seen nearly four
score years of our republican form of government.
The writer would gladly soften the roughness
with charity, had he ever witnessed a compensating
virtue or redeeming excuse for permitting the
money power to run the government, make the
laws and rule the people.</p>

<p>So great is the apparent fear, too, by the
money power that the government may pass into
the hands of the common people, and those less
than multi-millionaires may aspire to political
preferment, that organized leagues are spread
over the entire Northern states, like political fly-traps,
with plenty of the “<em>sticky stuff</em>,” in order
to hold the ignorant and indifferent to the support
of the rich and their party alliances. The
organization of wealth for increasing its influence
on legislation, or other purposes, under the
title of “The National Business Men’s League,”
is not looked upon in any very commendable
light by the average American, and has been
pronounced “unsavory” by many honest men.</p>

<p>“The promoters of this league,” says Senator
Quay, “invokes a class against the masses and
all other classes. No league of business men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
based upon wealth, can erect a government class
in this country. In the United States Senate we
have <em>millionaires</em> and business men <em>enough</em> to
serve all legitimate purposes. Senators are
needed who have no specialties, <em>but who will act
for the interests of the country in gross</em>, without special
affinities.</p>

<p>“The people most deserving of <em>a representation</em>,
and most in need of <em>legislative protection</em>, are the
<em>farmers</em>, the small <em>store-keepers</em>, the <em>artisans</em>, and
the <em>day-laborers</em>, and I stand by <em>them</em>, and against
this ‘league.’ I go into the barricades with the
<em>bourgeoisie</em> and the men in blouses.</p>

<p>“There must be less business and more <em>people</em>
in our politics, else the republican party and the
<em>country</em> will go to wreck. The <em>business</em> issues are
making our politics sordid and <em>corrupt</em>. <em>The tremendous
sums of money furnished by business men,
reluctantly</em> in most instances, are <em>polluting the well-springs
of our national being</em>.”</p>

<p>It is unpleasant to look upon the dark side of
any question, and especially that of our lovely
country, and still go on ignoring the lessons given
us by the fathers of the nation. When we compare
the administrations of Washington, Adams,
and others, with the present ravening greed for
place by those who look upon official position as
the gateway to sudden wealth, the inquiry suggests
itself, and the desire to know the points of
compass the nation is drifting, and at what <em>port</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the ship of state is expected to enter if continued
on the dark lines of the present chart?</p>

<p>History is full of object-lessons&mdash;storms, wrecks
and disasters that have ended all attempts to perpetuate
a republican form of government by the
power of organized wealth. Money is powerful,
and may govern for a season. But legislation
that concentrates the wealth of the nation into
the hands of a privileged few causes the government
to rest upon a sandy foundation. The common
people will eventually tire, become restless
and revengeful.</p>

<p>The money interests of the United States and
those of Europe are the same. And when the
accumulation becomes so great it can not satisfy
personal greed for gain, it finds its way into
landed investments, chiefly in the United States.
At the present rate of concentration and transfer
into realty, the period can not be far in the
future when all the valuable lands in the United
States will be owned and controlled by a few immensely
wealthy families in this country and in
Europe. The “money power,” with its “trusts,”
“combines,” high fences, barb-wired, armed police
on the outside and bulldogs within, may
smile at the success giving financial control of
the profits of all kinds of labor necessary in the
development and manufacture of the resources of
nature. Still, the aristocratic pyramid is incomplete
until the soil and profits from cultivation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
are owned and controlled by the “systematic and
satisfactory management of a ‘<em>land trust</em>.’”</p>

<p>It is manifest now that wealth is seeking unusual
investments in farming lands by the money
kings of Europe and America, when a single lord
of England can own three million acres in the
heart of the most fertile section of the United
States, and have his rack-rents sent to Viscount
Scully, in Europe. Sir Edward Reid owns two
million acres; the Marquis of Tweeddale, one
million seven hundred thousand acres, and several
others of the titled aristocracy of Europe
own farms ranging from forty thousand to three
million acres each, making in the aggregate an
area of several states. And quite recently fifty
million acres more have passed into the hands of
the English stockholders in the distribution of
the land grants to the Northern Pacific Railroad.
These large bodies of land owned by aliens&mdash;lords
of Europe, with the syndicates and American
monopolies and railroad grants,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and special
gifts by Congress of one hundred and ninety-seven
million six hundred and ninety-nine thousand
acres to the rich monopolies in this country
and Europe, amount to an area greater than the
sum of eleven states of average size, and which
may ere long be considered sufficient to constitute
a respectable nucleus for an “<span class="smcap">American Land
Trust</span>.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">OHIO&mdash;HER BEASTS, BIRDS, AND TREES: AIDS TO HIGHER CIVILIZATION.</span></h2>


<h3>BEASTS.</h3>

<p>In the absence of native beasts, birds, and
trees, a country is unfitted for the habitation of
man. Nature had given to Ohio these supports
to life and aids to civilization in great abundance.</p>

<p>The Indian was not inclined to improve his
“talents,” still he was exceedingly kind, through
instinct or wisdom, in preserving in nature’s
superlative beauty things necessary for the coming
man.</p>

<p>Of the various wild animals in Ohio, no one
species has ever shown greater numerical strength
than the gray squirrel. In the early settlements,
he often annoyed his new neighbors with his mischievous
habits and petty larcenies; nevertheless,
the pioneer was generally pleased to see
him, as at all seasons he was good for a savory
meal.</p>

<p>At times these little animals became so numerous
and destructive to crops they were more to
be feared than is the rabbit in California or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
grasshopper in Kansas. For many years, settlers
were obliged to guard their fields when planted
with corn, or droves of foraging bands would dig
up the hills and eat the growing grains; when
the crops matured, they were still more destructive,
and boys when quite young were
taught to handle the rifle, and when employed
as guards became expert marksmen. Most
every one old enough to use a gun could put a
ball through the head of a squirrel three times
in five or better on the topmost boughs of the
lofty hardwood timber which covered the face of
the country.</p>

<p>The amount of forest was so extensive and undisturbed
that the squirrel at times increased to
a degree which made him disastrous to crops in
spite of guards, guns, traps, and “deadfalls,”
and caused him to become a subject for legislation,
encouraging his destruction by obligations
and rewards. When becoming too numerous,
and subsistence scarce, they migrate to other
parts, and often in numbers so great it would require
many days for the marching column of
several miles in width to pass any given point.
The Ohio river was a favorable place to capture
and kill them, as they arrived on shore weak and
wet. Many were drowned in the attempt to
swim. The inhabitants along the river at such
times made it a business to kill them by wagon
loads to feed and fatten hogs.</p>

<p>The country through which an army of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
kind marched left nothing out doors in the way
of subsistence. The first migration of this kind
causing serious alarm occurred in 1807 directly
after corn-planting; and in all the southern counties
of the state, it became impossible to guard
the fields, and continued so long that the corn
crop was a failure over a large extent of country,
and farmers were obliged to buy grain for
bread.</p>

<p>The legislature was appealed to, and a statute
enacted the same year, making it imperative for
every person within the state, subject to the payment
of tax, to furnish a specified number of
squirrel scalps, to be determined by the trustees
of the township, whose duty it was to give the
lister the number required from each individual.
This was intended as a tax in addition to other
taxes, making the penalty for refusal or neglect
the same as that of a delinquent tax-payer. And
a non-tax-payer, and tax-payers furnishing scalps
in excess of the required number, were entitled
to two cents per scalp, to be paid from the funds
of the county. But, with all the boys and guns
and other devices for destruction to keep the
number down to a minimum, the usual amount
seemed but little changed, and squirrel raids continued,
occasionally, all the same.</p>

<p>A good story is told by an old lumberman,
who, in the early days of steamboating on the
Ohio river, contracted to deliver on board of
steamboat one hundred thousand shingles at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
“wood-landing” of one of the river counties in
Ohio. The shingles were stacked on the bank of
the river ready for shipment. A few days after,
the lumberman heard most of his “stuff” had
been stolen, and that it was probable it had gone
to Pittsburg. On receiving this unwelcome
news, he drove down to the river to look after
the condition of things. Before he reached the
place he found the woods alive with squirrels
marching toward the river.</p>

<p>On his return the workmen asked what discoveries
were made. The reply was, “The
shingles never went to Pittsburg;” “they all
went down the river, and it is useless to look
in Pittsburg or any other place for them.”...
“I got to the river just in time to know all
about it. You see, the squirrels are marching
and crossing the river at that point; and the
commanding general is not much on a swim,
and he carried one of my shingles down to the
water and rode over on it, and every colonel, captain,
lieutenant and commissioned and non-commissioned
officer did what they saw their general
do, and finally the rank and file made a raid, and
I got there just as an old squirrel came down to
the water dragging a shingle, which he shoved
into the river, jumped upon it, raised his brush
for a sail and went over high and dry; and
when near enough the other shore leaped off and
let his boat float down the stream. As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
these observations were taken in, I went up on
the high bank where the shingles had been
stored, and found there was not a shingle left&mdash;they
are down the river, gentlemen&mdash;down the
river, sure.”</p>

<p>This story receives a shadow of support from
the learned and cautious Buffon, who observes:
“Although the navigations of the grey squirrels
seem almost incredible, they are attested by so
many witnesses that we can not deny the fact.”
And in a note on the subject says: “The grey
squirrels frequently remove their place of residence,
and it not unoften happens that not one
can be seen one winter where they were in multitudes
the year before; they go in large bodies,
and when they want to cross a lake or river they
seize a <em>piece of the bark of a birch or lime, and
drawing it to the edge of the water, get upon it, and
trust themselves to the hazard of the wind and waves,
erecting their tails</em> to serve the purpose of <em>sails</em>;
they sometimes form a fleet of three or four
thousand, and if the wind proves too strong, a
general shipwreck ensues ... but if the
winds are favorable they are certain to make
their desired port.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The squirrel is an industrious and sagacious
animal. He lays up stores of provisions for
future use, and conceals them where others of
his kind are unable to find them. And his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
memory is so perfect, and location of place so
unerring, that in dead of winter, and short of a
meal, he will quit his warm nest in the hollow
limb of some tree, plunge into deep snow and go
direct a long distance to the exact spot where
months before he had buried a walnut or an acorn,
and dig down and get the treasure and return
with it to his home.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Squirrel Hunter.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was once said, “To number the Bison would
be like counting the leaves of the forest”&mdash;so,
too, the myriads of squirrels that inhabited the
unbroken forests of Ohio evidently approached in
number the incalculable hosts of buffalo that in
the grandeur of their numerical strength swept
over the western plains.</p>

<p>The rabbit multiplies six times as fast as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
squirrel, yet he has never appeared in such multitudes
as that of his bushy-tailed cousin. Happen
what may he is, however, always on hand.
He loves civilization and prefers the grassy fields,
standing corn and sunny hillsides to the wilds of
the forests, and is always as ready to care for the
waste apples in the orchard as he is to bark
around the young trees. He is an annoying
tenant&mdash;timid by nature and easily captured.
Millions are sold in the markets every year, but
can not come up in numbers with the squirrel in
his palmy days. The “one day’s rabbit shooting”
at Lamar, Colo., by two hundred guns,
December 31, 1894, resulted in the capture of
five thousand one hundred and forty-two (5,142);
but compared with a squirrel hunt in Franklin
county, Ohio, August 20, 1822, it does not appear
so large; when a less number of guns killed nineteen
thousand six hundred and sixty; and evidently
not a “very good day for squirrels to be
out either.”</p>

<p>No part of the North-west, in a state of nature,
was so well adapted to the propagation and preservation
of game beasts and birds as that
within the geographical limits of Ohio. To
show the immense amount of large game which
also existed long after settlements had been
made, it is but necessary to give the results
of a single day’s hunt, confined to one township
of five miles square, in the county of Medina,
December 24, 1818, and which is authentically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
described by Henry Howe in his “Historical
Collections of Ohio,” Vol. II, pages 463 to 467,
inclusive: “The accurate enumeration of the
game killed at the center (of the drive) resulted
as follows: <em>Seventeen</em> wolves, <em>twenty-one</em> bears,
<em>three hundred</em> deer, besides <em>turkeys</em>, <em>coons</em> and <em>foxes</em>
not counted.” The wolf-scalps were good for fifteen
dollars each, making a draw on the treasury
for two hundred and fifty-five dollars. Many
counties in Ohio were not formed nor settled
for nearly a quarter of a century after becoming
part of the state, and a few much later,
the last being that of Noble, in 1851, making in
all eighty-eight counties.</p>

<p>Consequently, game of all kinds remained in
abundance in Henry, Hancock, Hardin, Lucas,
Marion, Noble, Williams, and some others. As
late as 1845 two men in Williams county made
an effort to see who could kill the greater number
of deer, each confining his operations to a single
township of his own election. One selected Superior
and the other Center township; the hunt
to last sixty days.</p>

<p>At the expiration of the time, one had killed
ninety-nine and the other sixty-five. The success
of neither caused remarks of admiration
among the “squirrel hunters,” a few of whom
boastingly declared they could show a much
greater list in the given time if they were inclined
to hunt for quantity.</p>

<p>When the “Reports, Explorations and Surveys”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
were made to ascertain the most practicable
and economical route for a railroad from
the Mississippi river to the Pacific ocean, under
the direction of the Secretary of War,
in 1853 to 1856, the vast public domain was
shown to be rich in herds of buffalo, elk, deer,
and smaller game of both beasts and birds. It
was at this time the bison swarmed over all the
Western plains and hills, from the great rivers to
the ocean and from Canada to the Gulf in numbers
beyond the power of computation.</p>

<div id="Ref_174" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="600" height="371" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A Herd of Bison.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of all the quadrupeds known to inhabit the
earth, no one species ever marshaled such innumerable
armies as that of the American bison.
As late as 1871, it was estimated that south of
the Union Pacific Railroad line there were between
three and four million head. As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the road entered the territory the destruction began,
and by the reports of the Smithsonian Institution,
the miserable “pot-hunters” in 1872
killed over a million and a quarter; and during
the first three years after the road was completed
this band of thieves and murderers slaughtered
over three millions of these valuable animals,
taking the hides of some and tongues of others,
but leaving untouched where they fell more than
half of this immense number. As American
game the bison exists no more. The only few
remaining out of captivity are at Yellowstone
Park.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the policy of the government
in regard to the natural wealth of the
“public domain” has ever shown such a lack of
wisdom, forethought, and power as to permit the
immediate exhaustion leaving nothing for the
legitimate heirs. And it seems singular that
such a well known and immense storehouse of
national wealth, as that of the buffalo, the annuity
of which supported more than thirty thousand
natives of the country, should have been
left unprotected against those who have destroyed
the forests and killed the cattle on a thousand
hills.</p>

<p>Governor Isaac I. Stevens, in his report of estimates
of the Pacific Railroad in 1854 to Jefferson
Davis, Secretary of War, says: “The supplies
of meat for all the laborers on this line east
of the mountains ... will be furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
from the plains. The <em>inexhaustible</em> herds of
buffalo will supply amply the whole force till the
road is completed.”</p>

<div id="Ref_176" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="600" height="323" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Camp Red River Hunters.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There were at that time twenty-seven known
tribes of Indians west of the Missouri river, of
which the greater part subsisted by hunting the
buffalo; and he says of the hunters from Mouse
river valley to the Red river of the North:
“They make two hunts each year, leaving a portion
of their numbers at home to take care of
their houses and farms: One from the middle
of June to the middle of August, when they make
‘pemican’ and dry meat, and prepare the skins of
buffalo for lodges and moccasins; and again from
the middle of September to the middle of November,
when, besides the pemican and dried meat,
the skin is dried into robes.</p>

<p>“I estimate that four months each year two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
thousand hunters, three thousand women and
children, and eighteen hundred carts are on the
plains; and estimating the load of a cart at eight
hundred pounds, and allowing three hundred
carts for luggage, that twelve hundred tons of
meat, skins, and furs is their product of the
chase.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>“These people are simple-hearted, honest, and
industrious, and would make good citizens.
Each year they carry off to the settlements at
Pembina at least two million five hundred thousand
pounds of buffalo meat, dried, or in the
shape of pemican.” Large tribes, as the Gros
Ventres, Bloods, Piegans, and others, had hunted
and feasted for ages without diminishing the
number or strength of “the <em>inexhaustible</em> herds
of buffalo,” described by Governor Stevens in
1854.</p>

<p>This source of subsistence to a numerous and
poor people, and immense wealth to the nation,
was wantonly destroyed by the “<em>pot-hunter</em>,” who
is in no way related to the “squirrel hunter,”
but stands in about the same relation to the
sportsman as does the “missing link” to the
species he disgraces. He is a destructive animal,
and it is as useless to hope any species of game,
beast or bird, will ever exist in numbers too great
for this wily loafer to destroy, as it is to expect
legal enactments and penalties will ever prevent
him doing evil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>
<p>The selfishness that exterminated the buffalo&mdash;“<em>might
makes right</em>”&mdash;runs through the veins of
the white man. In the same report to the Secretary
of War in which Mr. Stevens calls attention
of settlers to “many pleasant valleys” that are
occupied by “friendly Indians&mdash;in some instances
described with log houses, cultivated fields,
barns, flocks and herds, mills and churches, with
good morals and observance of the Sabbath day&mdash;that
many tribes live in a rich and inviting country,
and are wealthy in horses, cattle, and hogs.”
He closes by saying: “Laws should be passed for
the extinguishment of the Indian title. Posts
are recommended with half regiments of mounted
men, with a battery of horse artillery, and one
of mountain howitzers; that all the Indians
west of the mountains ‘should be placed in
reservation,’ and the country opened to settlement.”</p>

<p>It is stated that with a small distribution
of presents and “prudence, judgment, and <em>display
of a small military force</em>, no difficulty will be
experienced in accomplishing these arrangements
so essential to the construction of the road.”
And it does not appear that the government protected
the rights of those in possession of the
“fertile valleys” any more than it did the game
it knew gave support to the people inhabiting the
country. If the same careless indifference and
love of greed that wantonly destroyed the game
beasts which existed upon the vast unoccupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
domain west of the Mississippi had in like manner
forestalled the settlement of the “North-west
Territory” by killing all the game, population
and civilization would have been suspended if
not made improbable within the past century.</p>

<p>The area of Ohio was well supplied with a
variety of the most attractive game, fed and
marked by Nature as her own, free for all&mdash;which
made the early settlements contented, independent,
and observing. No means of education
gives the mind so much satisfaction and confidence
in truth and reality as the study of the object
lessons received while living in a garden of
Nature, an invited guest.</p>

<p>“All self-educated persons,” says Doctor Newman,
“are likely to have more thought, more
mind, more philosophy, than those who are
forced to load their minds with a score of subjects
against an examination&mdash;who have too
much on their hands to indulge in thinking or investigation....
Much better is it for the
active and thoughtful intellect ... to eschew
the college and university altogether than to submit
to a drudgery so ignoble, a mockery so contumelious.</p>

<p>“How much more profitable for the independent
mind after the rudiments of education to pursue
the train of thought which his mother-wit
suggests! How much healthier to wander in the
fields, and there with the exiled prince to find</p>

<p class="center">‘Tongues in trees, books in running brooks.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p>How much more genuine an education is that of
the poor boy in the poem&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">‘As the village school and books a few supplied,’</p>

<p>contrived from the beach, and the quay, and
fisher’s boat, and the inn’s fireside, and the
tradesman’s shop, and shepherd’s walk, and
smuggler’s hut, and the mossy moor, and the
screaming gulls, and restless waves, to fashion
for himself a philosophy and poetry of his own.”
Sir Walter Scott long ago declared: “The best
part of every man’s education is that which he
gives himself.”</p>

<p>This was the nature of the school system in
Ohio. The young population grew up among
the beasts and birds and trees; each of which in
turn served as teacher. Not only the burley bear
and nimble deer, but even the pestiferous vermin,
were aiders and abettors in education and the
rise of the new civilization. The coons, the
foxes, the beavers, the otters, minks, muskrats,
and skunk, carried <em>legal tenders</em> with them and
furnished the chief circulating medium known to
the country for many years.</p>

<p>With the trained dog, the boys in the wilderness
were enabled to secure pelts to send to Boston
for books, which erected the superstructure
of more great men than can be found as the production
of any other state or country in a single
century. And to-day the intelligent squirrel
hunter makes a respectful bow to the little animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
for the honorable part they so successfully
performed in creating the new species and placing
Ohio permanently in the lead of a nation of
the best informed people in the world.</p>

<p>The number of species of birds found at various
times in Ohio amount to two hundred and ninety-two;
while the number breeding in the state is
placed at one hundred and twenty-nine; and if
the probable summer residents are counted the
number would be increased to one hundred and
seventy-one. An eminent ornithologist says in a
recent work: “To cast the horoscope of the bird-life
of the future is uncertain work, and perhaps
without profit; but the stars certainly predict
utter extermination of the finest of all game
birds&mdash;the wild turkey&mdash;and the diminution to
the point of extermination of the ruffed grouse,
the quail, the wood duck and wild pigeon.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Game birds as well as song birds would from
natural causes alone diminish in number, as their
selected homes or breeding places become destroyed
by clearing up the country. But in
addition to this, the unseasonable and inhuman
destruction by means of firearms has become so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
alarmingly great as to foretell that at no distant
day most of the desirable species of birds that
are permanent residents will have been destroyed.</p>

<p>It is generally known by the older “Squirrel
Hunters” that from their first knowledge of the
North-west to beginning of the railroad era, 1855,
Ohio was a paradise for the sportsman with dog
and gun. The fields abounded with covies of
quail; the forests with wild turkeys, grouse,
pigeons and squirrels; and the streams with
ducks and geese. Up to the period named the
conditions of the country underwent but few
changes detrimental to the propagation and preservation
of game, and the abundant supplies
afforded amusement and subsistence equaled at
present nowhere within the limits of the United
States.</p>

<p>The settlements as yet contained many reservations
of continuous tracts of undisturbed forest,
wild ranges, islands along the larger water-courses,
overflowing lands, unmolested parts of
large estates, military and school reservations,
etc., often embracing sections of rich soil heavily
timbered and densely covered with an undergrowth
of bushes, and in topography well adapted
for resorts and homes of game birds and beasts.</p>

<p>Few, if any, of those timbered reservations
failed to be occupied by every species and variety
of nature’s household. Some locations from time
immemorial had been the favorite and undisputed
habitation of that most wonderful American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
bird, the wild turkey. For he is not migratory,
nor an aimless wanderer of the forest. His
instincts and attachments to place, the home of
his ancestors, are so great that generations after
generations live and die in the same selected site
of wild territory. No persecution can induce
him to abandon his accustomed haunts. Nothing
but death or the removal of his forest ends his
family.</p>

<p>The area of his home requires several square
miles, and includes a nursery, feeding grounds,
ranches, roosts and places of refuge in times of
danger. And if by pursuit he is obliged to flee
beyond the limit of his range, he returns to his
associates, to his familiar trees, rocks and mountain
streams.</p>

<p>The turkey is indigenous to America, and not
found wild in any other part of the world. He
resides in unsettled sections of timbered countries,
from Mexico to the forests of Canada, and
is the wildest, most intelligent and untamable of
all the birds. When taken directly from the
shell, and reared either by hand or with domesticated
turkeys, he will, when grown, separate
from friends and accustomed comrades, and instinctively
seek the more attractive life of the
forest. No care and kindness can in one or two
generations overcome the fear of man and love
for the wilds, and it requires many generations
of skilled schooling to extinguish the desire for
roving and give to him that contented and confiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
disposition which characterizes the domesticated
bird. The writer does not believe it
possible for a bird that has been reared in a state
of nature, and felt the charms of the wilderness,
to ever become reconciled to any other conditions
of life. He once brought down a young full-grown
female bird and captured her. When she
found resistance useless, she cried most pitifully.
She had suffered no injury excepting a broken
tip of one wing, which was amputated and
dressed. The bird was kept in a large cage in
the back yard for two years, remaining concealed
during the day and partaking of food and water
late in the evening, and then in the absence of
every object of fear. In due time she was removed
to a garden overgrown with bushes of currants,
gooseberries, raspberries, etc., interspersed
with strawberry plants, and with her a pair of
tame turkeys. Here she remained over two
years without manifesting the least indication of
making the acquaintance of her civilized relations.
A misplaced board on the fence gave her
the boon so much desired&mdash;freedom. It was the
beginning of summer when she escaped and was
searched for, but seen no more until the following
spring, when she was noticed several times
near the tame turkeys, and this always very early
in the morning.</p>

<p>That she could get there at that hour, or get
there at all from the timbered land near a mile
distant, through farms and fences, seemed remarkable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
as she could not fly. After harvest of
that year she frequented the stubble fields near
the timber, with four well-grown half-breeds,
as wild as herself. The next spring she commenced
visiting her old acquaintances again,
but, unfortunately, fell in sight of a pot-hunter,
and was brought in as a great prize. But those
who had kindly cared for the misfortunes of the
bird, and now looked upon her lifeless form, had
feelings which the word indignation failed to
express.</p>

<p>The turkey propagated in foreign countries
soon becomes degenerated, and in every way
much inferior to the American type, the high
standard of which in this country is kept up by
infusion of wild blood and liberal forest ranges
adapted to the nature of the bird.</p>

<p>The wild turkey has many peculiarities not
found in any other species. Other birds elect
certain localities to spend their nights, while the
wild turkey puts up wherever night overtakes
him; for his range is his home, and he is at
home any-where in his range. When roosting in
considerable numbers, the flock is dispersed over
an extensive area of forest. He seldom, if ever,
roosts two consecutive nights in or near the same
place. When the leaves are on the trees he goes
to the topmost twigs of the highest trees, and
lets his heavy body down upon the foliage and
small branches, and fixes himself for the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
so he can not be seen by enemies from above nor
from below. When the forest is bare he is still
more careful to withdraw from observation, and
for this purpose selects large, rough and broken
trees&mdash;trees with ugly, crooked limbs, with knots
and deformities&mdash;and places himself near some
bump, crook, or place where the addition of his
body will be readily overlooked; for well does he
understand that the ordinary pot-hunter expects
to see him perched upon a small limb far out
from the body of the tree, standing on his legs,
with outstretched neck and elevated head. But,
instead of making a show, he always does the
best he can to conceal himself, and if nothing
better appears at hand, he will take to a large
horizontal limb, and near the trunk of the tree
flatten his body down on the upper part and
stretch out the neck and legs on line with the
limb, so to resemble closely a slight enlargement
on that part of the growth.</p>

<p>He knows so well how to conceal himself when
roosting that he laughs at the possibility of being
seen and captured by the marvelous hunters who
have <em>killed so many by moonlight</em>! The arrival of
man and gun in his forest is scented and signaled
at once. The birds most exposed fly far in advance
of the hunter, and those that feel safe
keep still and are safe from observation.</p>

<p>The writer admits, after testing this mode of
hunting after night, many times, many seasons,
and with many persons, that he has never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
able to find a turkey on a tree while roosting.
He has seen, however, and measured the credibility
of the individual who insists that he has
captured a great many snipe in cold, dark winter
nights, by holding a light at the open mouth of
a bag while other persons drive them in, but has
never been able to find the individual who shot a
wild turkey while sitting on the roost.</p>

<p>A friend who had become infatuated with the
idea of night-hunting, insisted that turkeys could
be seen on bare trees when the moon was as light
and bright as then; and the reason he had not
been heretofore successful was owing entirely to
the “if.” As soon as the moon was declared all
right we were on the grounds; could hear birds
flying off the trees in advance of us as soon as
we entered the border. Every tree in our pathway
was scanned, without seeing an object resembling
a turkey. The writer soon tired of the
amusement and retraced his steps some distance,
and sat down upon an old log lying on the sand
in the deep-cut bed of a creek.</p>

<p>After waiting a reasonable time and hearing
nothing from the friend, the writer called&mdash;waited
and called a number of times; but all remained
silent. Thinking the hunter had become
bewildered and wandered beyond the range of
vocal sounds, fired one barrel of the gun off,
pointing it in the direction of the moon, which
was partially obscured by some of the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
branches of a large sycamore tree, standing on
the bank of the opposite side of the creek.</p>

<p>The gun made a loud report, and so did a large
gobbler as he came flapping down through the
branches into the creek, having received a mortal
charge of shot. The signal gun soon brought in
the absent member of the expedition, who, on
feeling a twenty-pound bird and hearing the explanation,
moved it be made unanimous, as the
only successful way to shoot wild turkeys by
moonlight.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of this bird may be mentioned.
In the spring of the year the female
birds straggle long distances from the flock, and
seek temporary separation in the more open but
unfrequented parts of the forest, where the male
birds seldom, if ever, resort. Here they nest and
rear their young. When the offspring is well
grown the mother birds, with young, return to
the flock, after which old and young, male and
female, remain together as one family during fall
and winter.</p>

<p>In-door naturalists and authors have given to
the world many singular and absurd statements
respecting the habits, sagacity and instincts of
the wild turkey, since the truthful descriptions
penned by John James Audubon, F.R.S., S.L.
and E. And it is singular that the eminent naturalist,
Thomas Nuttall, A.M.T., L.S. and C.,
should say he is not gregarious.</p>

<p>Charles Hallock, the able editor of “Forest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Stream,” author of “Camp Life,” “Sportsman’s
Gazetteer,” etc., states that in the spring wild
turkeys “pair off” (like blue-birds), “and after
the young are hatched both parents take great
interest in the growth and progress of the young
family;” that they are “easily tamed; are
slaughtered by moonlight while roosting; that it
is rarely a wing-shot can be procured; that they
are killed by sportsmen in various ways,” most of
which is not much less at variance with facts in
nature than the statement of Mr. Burrell Symmes,
who claimed that he had outwitted the sagacity
of the bird, and killed at one shot, with a rifle,
a large flock that infested a wheat-stack near
their range. “The turkeys would gather around
the stack, every few days, as close as they could
crowd their bodies, pulling out wheat-heads
to eat;” and, taking in the situation, says he
bent the barrel of his gun to the segment of a
circle corresponding to the diameter of the area
of the base of the stack. And well loaded with
powder and leaden ball, concealed the weapon at
the proper adjustment, placing himself in view
of the situation, with a cord attached to the
trigger. The turkeys came, and unsuspectingly
crowded around the stack, and began their accustomed
repast. Now was the moment for action&mdash;“the
cord was pulled, and the gun fired,
which sent the ball round and round the stack,
until it mowed down every last turkey in the
flock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Respecting the habits and peculiarities of the
wild turkey, the author turned up a slip from the
lips of an old North Carolina negro, who gives
the best pen-picture of the home-life of the bird
that has fallen to the notice of ornithologists.
The authography is somewhat objectionable, but
the whole story is well told. Among other things
he says the wild turkey is a “mighty peert
fowl;” that he can sometimes teach a fox how to
be smart, while at other times a sucking calf is not
half so big a fool as he makes of himself; that he
had known gobblers to outwit all the hunters in the
country, and then walk into some ordinary colored
man’s “pen” and stay there, “a cranin he neck,
an’ tryen to get out at de top w’at been all roof
over, wile de hole in de groun’ w’at he came in
at stans wide open.”</p>

<p>The “pen” was a fatal device, capturing annually
thousands of those birds during early settlements.
Before the extensive forests disappeared
turkeys lived well in the fall and winter
and fattened on the mast. But owing to the
love for Indian corn they were by a moderate display
of this food easily enticed into traps, called
“pens,” when placed in secluded sections of forest
where the birds were known to seek subsistence.</p>

<p>Pens were usually constructed of windfalls&mdash;old
limbs of various sizes&mdash;making an inclosure
of ten or twelve feet square, four feet in height,
and covered with similar limbs weighted down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
with other limbs placed across the covering. A
trench, eighteen or twenty inches deep and about
the same width, cut to enter the pen two feet,
terminating abruptly slanting upward. Over the
part of the trench next to the wall were secured a
number of small poles forming a bridge a foot
wide. Outside of the pen the trench extended,
rising gradually, until it reached the level of the
surrounding ground.</p>

<p>When finished, the trap would be well-baited
with corn in the center and in the trench. Small
quantities were scattered off in different directions
from the pen, and a few grains here and
there for a mile or more. After the birds would
find a few grains, the entire flock would engage
in search for more, and soon the trail of corn
leading to the pen would be discovered, and rushing
along in haste would enter the trench unawares,
and forcing the front birds in the trench
under the bridge and up into the pen before
danger was suspected. As soon as those in the
inclosure discovered the situation, they would
try to force their way through the openings in
the pen, passing and repassing around and over
the bridge with heads erect, never observing the
opening by which they entered&mdash;their comrades
would soon disappear, leaving the unfortunate
birds to be taken out by the trapper.</p>

<p>In a good location a single pen would furnish
one hundred or more turkeys during a winter.
One year, J. J. Audubon kept an account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
produce of a pen which he visited daily and
found that seventy-six had been caught in it, in
about two months. Seven was the highest number
he had ever succeeded in taking from a pen
at one time, but knew of as many as eighteen
being captured by others. The average success
of a pen, per capture, ranged from four to five.
The writer has known fifteen to be the fruits of
the first visit, and no more caught that season.</p>

<p>To make the pen a success, required great care
and attention. The timber necessary for the construction
was gathered from windfalls showing
woodland decay; any marks of the axe, or civilization
were considered objectionable. The earth
taken out to make the trench, leading to and into
the pen, was carefully removed to other parts;
old leaves were thrown into the trench and about
the pen, making every thing in the vicinity look
ancient and accidental.</p>

<p>In many settlements the success of trapping
pens was of short duration. As the country
soon furnished easy access of the birds to large
fields of their favorite food, they no longer could
be induced to enter the baited pens. Notwithstanding
the number captured by means of pens&mdash;“slaughtered
by moonlight”&mdash;“by baiting”&mdash;“by
treeing with dogs,” turkeys remained quite
plentiful for more than sixty years after the
settlement of Ohio. They were to be found in
the woodlands all over the state, and for half a
century remained the king-bird of the sportsman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
When frightened, he seeks cover and lies
well to a point. Early in the morning is the
most propitious time to find him. When a flock
is flushed and frightened by the rapid motions of
a dog, some will fly and others run in the direction
of security and cover; it may be a mile
or more distant, and if so the sportsman will
most surely pick up a straggler or two on his way,
if he and his dog understand their business.</p>

<p>If any have taken to the trees, it will be lost
time to look after them&mdash;they have made another
fly in the direction taken by the leaders, who
prefer the use of feet to wings. The dog must
now keep close to his master, who moves so
cautiously and quietly, that he talks to his companion
by signs and motions altogether. The
birds are so wonderfully fearful of a dog, and
are now so frightened that some, while on the
way to the place of refuge, will drop down in
a secure looking spot to regain composure or to
await till all is quiet. It is these the sportsman
is after. Old logs, fallen tree-tops, piles of old
brush, blackened limbs, tufts of weeds and spots
of dead prairie grass grown in small openings
among timber, afford attractive points for concealment,
and are all remembered with reverence
and respect as monuments of departed birds, at
the death and obsequies of which the writer had
been present.</p>

<p>The hunter must be prepared to find a bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
anywhere on the line of march. The dog carries
the scent and his every movement determines the
distance the birds are off. Now he moves with
cat-like stealth&mdash;he stops with tetanic muscular
tension, quivering in every fiber, stands elongated&mdash;a
fixed immovable figure&mdash;his marvelous nose
has caught the image and measured the distance,
which in silence says, stop!&mdash;move not,
as eyes and nose direct to the place some
twenty or thirty yards distant. The bird is
there, and the canine head knows the result
of another step in that direction&mdash;the hunter
summoning all his skill and coolness, takes a
step or two forward, and the bird is flushed, and
starts off with the velocity of a grouse, testing
sporting ability and rapidity of motion that rewards
in hearing the monster fall; and a second
later the quiet salute by the faithful and well-trained
dog, showing he is elated equally with his master.</p>

<p>Quite often a turkey will carry a mortal charge
a long distance and drop dead. Remains of dead
birds are so frequently found during the hunting
season, that there can be but little doubt many
shot at and get away, die from their wounds.
And the hunter should not despair of success if
his shot on the wing does not come to the ground
immediately. Instances in great numbers are
before the writer, some of which are marked
by more than ordinary singularity, where the
recovery of the bird has taken place, quite unexpectedly,
after a pronounced miss. One bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
cold afternoon, while out with a friend, who
shot at a bird as it was flying through the timber;
it continued on its course and was observed for a
long distance to fly naturally but to go down
too abruptly. The locality where observation
ended was hunted closely and easily, as there
was a crusted snow on the ground, but without
finding as much as a feather. As we were returning,
and within a few rods of the spot where
the bird we had been searching for was shot at,
another turkey came sailing over with tremendous
velocity, going in the direction taken by the first
one. It was given a barrel loaded with Ely’s Green
Cartridge, No. 5 shot. The bird went on and
down, but this time we marked the locality more
accurately and were soon at the place and found
two turkeys, dead and warm, within a few feet
of each other. Some years before this, while
standing in a little opening, early in the morning,
listening for turkey sounds, the report of a gun
was heard near half a mile distant, and in a moment
a large gobbler fell dead at the writer’s
feet.</p>

<p>While out with two young dogs, a bird was
flushed on the bank of the Scioto river, and received
a shot when near the opposite side, which
so injured and confused him that he came back
and fell upon the side of the stream from which
he started. The heavy body came down with a
thud, close to the shore, among some weeds and
bushes near a large pile of drift-wood. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
dogs were at the place in quick time, but could
find no turkey. Thinking it had crawled into
the drift, we tried to have the dogs hunt the drift.
But they knew better and took no heart in spending
time at that point, and required constant restraint
to prevent them from taking the forest.
After an ineffectual examination of the cover afforded
by the drift, the superior judgment of
the dogs was taken, and with management, their
noses kept the course of this wounded bird and
followed his meanderings one and a half miles in
an air line from the drift to the point where they
came to the bird on a stand. Walking up, expecting
a flush, I was surprised to find a dead turkey,
warm, muddy, and wet with the dew of the
morning.</p>

<p>While it is quite common for a turkey, when
mortally wounded, to continue his flight considerable
distances before falling, and equally, if not
more so, to fall dead at once from the shot, it is
not often one will, while on the wing making his
escape, change his course of conduct and come
down and give himself up without being touched
by shell or shot. Still, it is not impossible, for
he has been known to do so, but not, perhaps, for
the reason said to be entertained by Captain
Scott’s coon.</p>

<p>One still, warm afternoon in December, 1860,
with dog, the writer visited the “Fenced-in Wilderness.”
On arrival in the woods a concealed
position was selected and the dog sent out to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
up the birds. Soon a large male bird came so
near, on foot and unseen, that he scented the
hunter, and rose within less than twenty yards
of the writer, who fired after him one of
Ely’s green wire cartridges, one and a half
ounces No. 5 shot, driven by three drachms
of Hazard’s electric powder. The bird was up
in the air about thirty feet, going off directly in
line with the shot. When the gun reported the
turkey did not limber nor tumble like a bird shot,
but came down precisely like a paper kite&mdash;full
spread of wings and tail, with outstretched neck
and legs. When the writer came up he was lying
upon the ground, spread out like a bat, and the
captor placed one foot and weight of the body
on his neck, and commenced reloading the empty
barrel. Before this was half accomplished it became
necessary to suspend reloading and attend
to the customer by changing his neck from the
foot to the hand, in order to keep him long
enough to cut his throat. During the time required
to open the knife and perform this little
surgical operation he used his legs and toenails
most vigorously and effectively, and the
operator came out of the fray bleeding and lacerated,
with loss of the greater portion of coat,
vest, shirt and pants. The wounds, however severe,
were as nothing compared with the knowledge
demonstration revealed&mdash;that this turkey
was knocked down by the generation of some
force, without making a scar, mark, or sign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
traumatism, external or internal. A critical examination
revealed no injury whatever, except
the cut made by the knife. The explanation is
for the scientist.</p>

<p>It requires a good gun, a good load and a good
shot to bring down a full-grown, well-feathered
turkey. Seldom they rise short of thirty yards
distant; then, by the powerful motor assistance
of the legs at the start, the next thirty yards are
made with such velocity that by the time the gunner
has “spoken his piece,” the bird is off so far
that loose No. 5 shot and a fair charge of powder
will not be effective unless by mere accident. This
became manifest at the beginning of the Fifties.
Having flushed a very large flock of turkeys near
town by means of a little cocker, that made a
terrible ado after them in the standing cornstalks,
near the Scioto river&mdash;after hunting them unsuccessfully
in the timber, a strip of prairie grass
was entered, full of “nigger-heads,” extending
parallel with the river for a full half-mile. The
grass was tall, and the freezing weather had
stiffened the ground and frozen over the pools, so
it could be walked over with safety. As the
grass was entered the little dog became invisible;
but it was soon discovered where he was by the
flight of a turkey out of range, and before the
cocker could be brought under control he flushed
several more. It was not long, however, before
a good wing shot was obtained, and the writer
started home with a load. This success and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
close proximity to town induced a number of amateur
gunners to try their luck, and they were directed
to the locality; for it was certain, if the turkeys
were concealed in the grass, they would remain
there if undisturbed until their time for moving&mdash;the
dusk of evening.</p>

<p>From what was subsequently known, it would
appear that the whole flock, consisting of forty
or fifty birds, still frightened, had found their
way back to this place of security and concealment,
and, without the aid of dogs, were walked
up and shot at by the party, but without capturing
a single bird.</p>

<p>The hunters returned with sorrow and disappointment.
One of their number, a prominent
lawyer and ex-member of Congress, came in with
the loss of one eye and otherwise disfigured for
life by the explosion of his gun.</p>

<p>At the close of the War of the Rebellion a
large amount of uncultivated, wild land, owned
by non-residents, was sold in small farms to settlers;
and a general disposition prevailed, from
high prices of produce, to improve much of the
better class of timber lands every-where, underbrushing
for pasture, or deadening the large timber
for corn, and this had some influence in decimating
game. Still the game resorts, uninhabitable
in this way, amounted to little compared
with influence and facilities increased railroads
gave the pot-hunter to go on with his work of
extermination in those mammoth parks of forests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in the eastern and southern borders of the state,
where the deer, turkey, grouse, and wild-pigeon
should have found protection and a home to the
end of time.</p>

<p>And with a diversified and wild section of country
large enough to accommodate and furnish annually
thousands of game, beasts, and birds, some
are entirely extinct, and others scarcely known
within the limits of the state. Such destruction is
truly an injustice to a beneficent creator that fed the
hungry, clothed the naked, made pioneer homes
happy and a savage wilderness a desirable habitation
for the pilgrims of a better civilization.</p>

<p>It is more to be regretted that in the general
destruction the grandest bird in the world&mdash;indigenous
alone to America&mdash;and whose love for
“liberty” exceeds all other species, should be
denied room enough among a liberty-loving
people for a home. It seems a pity Benjamin
Franklin had not been more than “half in earnest”
when he suggested this bird as the emblem
of our national independence. But as it is, in
other ways he has advanced civilization and
been a benefactor to the human race. His surpassing
size, tender, juicy, and gamey-flavored
flesh, places him far above all other gallinaceous
birds; and his goodness and greatness are known
over the world, and those who occupy his native
country have secured for his name a <em>place</em> among
the saints, to be chanted annually on a day set
apart for <em>thanksgiving and praise</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Railroad facilities enabled pot-hunters to flood
the country, to shoot for eastern saloons and
cold-storage houses, until the rapid decimation
of valuable game gave reasons for serious apprehension
that both birds and beasts will become
exterminated or taken from the sources of food
supply. An annual depletion of the quantity of
game in a given locality is generally borne well,
and is, to a limited extent, beneficial. They
usually stand assessments of numbers much better
than encroachments upon their borders. And
it is sometimes singular where they all go to,
when the woods in which they have always lived
become cleared up, so they are obliged to transfer
their possessions. An estate in the Military District,
consisting of two thousand acres, remained
wild until 1862. The agent at this date had the
land cleared of the young growth of trees and
bushes and put in grass.</p>

<p>Two years after, while riding along a road
that led through this piece of timber, the writer
saw a stately wild turkey, with head erect and
measured steps, marching through the open timber,
occasionally stopping, as though looking
and listening for former companions. On the
same road, after several hours, we again saw the
disappointed bird on his way back to tell the sad
story.</p>

<p>The wild turkey is now exterminated in Ohio,
and the indications are he will soon be as little
known as the Dodo. During his stay in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
aid and interests of civilization, thousands of
Squirrel Hunters were made happy, and for
nearly three hundred years he has been placed
at the head of the feast with all the compliments
bestowed upon him in 1621 by Priscilla Holmes:
“The foremost of all delicacies&mdash;roast turkey&mdash;dressed
with beech-nuts.”</p>

<p>The quail, another valuable game bird, has,
until within a few years, been an abundant, permanent
resident of the state. It is scarcely necessary
to say a word in his praise, for Bob White
is a smart little fellow, an early riser, and worth
millions to agricultural interests while living, and
unequaled on toast when dead.</p>

<p>At the date of the first settlements in the territory
the bird was undoubtedly very retired, as
well as few in number. The extensive and dense
forests, covering almost the entire country, made
it ill adapted to his nature; and those which were
enabled to perpetuate existence occupied some of
the limited open tracts of land found here and
there over the country. Bob White is really a
bird of civilization. He flourishes most near the
abodes of man. The cultivation of the soil and
settlement of the country increases his numbers.
In support of these conclusions we will here refer
to the fact contained in a statement made by a
gentleman who, with family, settled in Ohio in
the spring of 1798, and located on the border of
a small prairie&mdash;seemingly a favorable situation
for the bird. He resided several years in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
locality, raising wheat, corn, and other kinds of
produce, without hearing the voice of the quail.
He had about abandoned the anticipation of quail
shooting, and questioned if it would ever be recognized
as a sport in Ohio.</p>

<p>One day in early summer of 1802 he thought
he heard the recognized though suppressed sound,
“Bob White.” Somewhat doubting the sense of
hearing, he immediately made observations and
procured additional evidence&mdash;that of sight.
Yes, he actually heard and saw the bird for the
first time in Ohio. Elated with the good news,
he proceeded to the cabin and told his discovery
with so much excitement and enthusiasm that it
created a laugh at his expense. He excused his
manner, however, by saying, “It was sufficient
to excite any one to know that a highly-esteemed
and familiar friend had found the way through
such an interminable wilderness, and announced
his arrival in that modest and meaning way,
‘Bob White.’” Since then he has been known as
a permanent resident.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the year the old birds,
with the family increase, remain in coveys. In
early spring this general attachment is broken
up by pairing, each pair selecting a locality,
where they remain during the breeding season.
When mating and selection of locality has taken
place, it is known by the demonstration of the
male, who gives the whole neighborhood due notice
of his domestic intentions by frequent repetitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of his cheerful and well-known notes,
“Bob White! Bob White!”</p>

<p>When paired the two are constant companions,
ever watchful and devoted to the welfare of each
other, sharing equally the duties and responsibilities
of wedded life; and from the appearance
of the first offspring to their settlement in the
world, as faithful father and mother, remain unceasing
protectors and providers for the family.
This extraordinary strength of attachment and
exhibition of natural affection has attracted the
attention of all their friends.</p>

<p>While living on a farm the writer discovered a
nest, nicely concealed by tufts of grass after being
constructed, under the projecting end of a
fence rail. At the time there were in it five eggs.
This number increased daily until twenty-three
eggs filled the nest, and incubation began. All
went on happily, until one morning there was
evidently great distress in that little household.
The male bird was sounding his anxious alarm&mdash;going
hurriedly from one part of the farm to that
of every other&mdash;sometimes flying, sometimes running;
stopping a moment here, a moment there;
calling at the top of his voice for his mate, in his
peculiar tone of distress. His unanswered cry
soon told the tale&mdash;some accident, some ruthless
hawk, some sneaking cat, or some other enemy,
had captured and destroyed his faithful companion.</p>

<p>He kept his calling for several hours, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
coming quite near, making a low chittering
noise, as if suspicious something could be told&mdash;that
the writer could tell him where his love had
gone. Far from it, he too was in search of anything
that could give a clue to the whereabouts
of the unfeeling wretch that had done the bloody
deed&mdash;he too was excited, and would have executed
the severest penalty known on the guilty
one, if found.</p>

<p>The nest was occasionally observed during the
forenoon, with merely the thought she might be
testing the affection of her lord, or playing him
a practical joke; but no, the eggs were, at each
visit uncovered. About noon-day, his lamentations
ceased, and hoping his mate had returned,
the nest was again visited, and was surprised to
find Bob on the nest, keeping life in the prospective
family.</p>

<p>For several days he left the nest frequently to
make further search for his missing sweetheart.
One morning, as usual, I called to see how the
little widower was getting along, and found
nothing but a bundle of shells&mdash;every egg had
been hatched. Not far from the nest was heard
a crickety sound&mdash;“chit, chit, chit”&mdash;and soon
discovered Bob with his brood. He continued to
care for the motherless young, as the writer can
testify from frequent meetings, and reared a fine,
large covey, which received protection and sympathy
during the following fall and winter, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
all the farm hands and sportsmen, who knew
him and his well-behaving family.</p>

<p>Quail are not strictly granivorous. In autumn
and winter they subsist chiefly on grain, berries
and weed seeds. But in the spring and summer
their food is almost exclusively composed of
worms and insects. While Henry William Herbert
extols the benefits the agriculturist derives
from the consumption of weed seeds by these
birds, he does not seem to have been aware the
quail is the greatest worm and insect enemy of
all the birds of North America, and are of more
valuable service to crops and trees than all other
birds combined. A few coveys carefully preserved
would protect the farmer against the
ravages of many destructive insects, which are
more to be feared than the “rag-weed, the dock,
or the brier.” The writer examined one accidentally
killed, several years ago, in the month
of June, and its crop contained seventy-five
“<em>potatoe-bugs</em>,” besides numerous smaller insects.
And, if for no other reason, the farmer should
protect the bird as his best and most reliable exterminator
of worms and insects, which, if undisturbed,
accumulate to the great detriment of
growing grain and grass, and to orchards and
gardens. The quail regards man as his friend,
though a stranger to his sympathy and protection.
If not for ill-treatment and general manifestation
to exterminate his species by those
whose friendship he courts, he would soon become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
quite as domestic as the barnyard poultry.
In fact, he frequently presses his claims perseveringly
in this line by establishing partnership
and social relations with domestic fowls. It is
not uncommon to find a hen and quail occupying
the same nest, until the complement of eggs are
deposited by each, at the end of which time the
quail usually submits the incubation to her
partner.</p>

<p>Quail are pursued by man, beast, bird, and reptile;
but with a fair opportunity and timely
warning they manifest a wonderful faculty for
evading their foes; and, excepting the “pot-hunter,”
they are provided with ample means
for self-preservation. He who steals upon a
covey while enjoying the sunshine by some
stump, log, or fence-corner, seated in a space less
than the circumference of a half-bushel measure,
and betrays a confidence by firing upon
them in this unsuspecting attitude, filling his
bag with the dead, and marching off with the
brand of “sneak-thief” upon his brow, is a “pot-hunter.”
He, too, who, with a show of indifference,
rides about, pretending to be overseeing
his own affairs, whistling around until the poor
unsuspecting birds, in order to get out of his
way, unconsciously walk into a net prepared for
them, and as a reward for this confiding friendship
triumphantly mashes their heads, is a pot-hunter.
Against such the bird has no protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>When coveys have warning of danger, and
wish to evade detection, they will conceal themselves
from their enemies, in a most magical
manner, by a singular concerted action, seemingly,
withholding their “scent,” so it is often
impossible for the best dogs to detect them, even
in the most favorable cover. It is quite amusing
to witness the changes that come over the amateur
sportsman when he fails to put up his birds.
He knows where they are, at least he thinks he
does, for he “marked them down” in the meadow
of short grass within a few yards of a stump or
tree. Then, it is such a commentary on his
dogs, for he knows they are all right&mdash;never better,
truer noses; still they go over and over, round
and round, without winding a bird, or coming to
a point. There! that dog has flushed a bird!
Now he is assured the whole covey are within
twenty feet of that spot; and he renews his
search, and keeps his dogs going over and over
the same locality, until both dogs and gunner,
disgusted, quit the place.</p>

<p>How they got away, and where they all went
to, and why that single bird remained where the
covey went down, and why the dogs did not point
that bird, all passed through the mind of the
hunter, as he marched on in search of better
luck.</p>

<p>The amateur perhaps meets his experienced
friend, to whom he relates his disappointment,
and who in reply proposes to return to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
meadow of the “marked down” covey. After
a time they do so, and every dog at once winds
his bird; and each come to point&mdash;these are
flushed and shot at. The dogs are made to move
cautiously, and again the trio stand, each having
a bird under point. This is repeated until every
bird has gone the gauntlet.</p>

<p>Quail shooting has been, but is no longer, an
interesting field sport in Ohio. Wing shooting,
while diminishing the aggregate number, by
subtracting from each covey, does not often destroy
the entire family, and under proper legislation,
has its benefits and advantages, and
generally insures the preservation of an abundance
to propagate another season. The sport,
also, to some extent, draws from the destructive
spoils of the pot-hunter and trapper, making the
birds coy, suspicious and not easily seen. True,
there is a possibility that the sportsman with dog
and gun may destroy a whole family by shooting
on the wing. A chapter of this kind occurred
to the writer. While riding along the road in a
buggy with a friend, our pointer companion came
to a stand some distance in front, with nose and
tail paralleled to the line of fence. The birds rose
by concert in line along the fence, while the rear
bird, or first to rise was covered and fired at.
The atmosphere was so the smoke obscured results,
excepting that of a wounded bird crossing
the road for a sorghum field. An effort was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to intercept and capture it, but failed. The
friend who sat in the buggy and had a good view
of the situation, declared every bird fell. A
walk over the ground proved it true, as from the
first to the last in the distance of about twenty
yards or more, eleven dead birds were picked up.
The next day on passing the spot, the dog came
to a point on a wounded bird, which was captured
and killed as a kindness. Here the whole
covey was exterminated; but as the perpetrator
felt “sorry” for the act, and did not intend it,
and would never do it again, it should not be
considered unpardonable.</p>

<p>The quail is a bird favorable to the happiness
of man and advancement of civilization, is of inestimable
value as a permanent resident, for the
reason he is independent of forests for the maintenance
of existence and perpetuation. He
is the bird of field and farm and the only
one from which a single pair can produce and
rear to maturity more than half a hundred young
in one season, to present as choice morsels of food
for the weary farmer and protector.</p>

<p>It is comforting to the sportsman to feel assured
there is one resident game bird the iniquity
of the pot-hunter can not exterminate. So long
as forests and mountains last, the Ruffed Grouse
will be able to maintain an abiding place. And
many are the pleasant reminiscences of the
hunter connected with the pursuit of this wary
bird; it is a sport once enjoyed can never be lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
from among the sunny associations of the past.
Even the name brings to view the ragged mountains,
rocky ravines, shady dells, babbling brooks
and quiet streams in forests, ripe with every
shade and tint of autumn colors, quiet secluded
places where nature reveals her sweetest charms
in inimitable splendor that mocks the artist’s
pencil and poet’s pen&mdash;the home and haunts of
this beautiful bird.</p>

<p>It does not seem reasonable that the indifference
of the people should permit the depopulation
of the earth of all its birds! It is sorrowful
to contemplate a place where no bird exists
excepting the “English sparrow.” Of the known
species, amounting to over five thousand, that
once glorified the life and beauty of the earth,
more than one-half the number has already disappeared
forever.</p>

<p>The Chicago Tribune, of August 11, 1895, on
the “Destruction of Birds,” tells the truth, a
horrible truth, when it says: “If masculine
greed and cruelty, and feminine vanity and
thoughtlessness, are not in some manner restrained
or punished, it is only a question of time,
and very short time at that, how soon the earth
will lose its birds.” That the Seattle Argus
called attention to the danger of the utter extermination
of game birds by the destruction of
their eggs on the Alaska breeding grounds&mdash;ducks,
geese, swans, and other migratory birds,
seek the low lands along the Yukon river for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
their nesting places. The egg-hunters gather
their eggs by millions in these as well as other
localities in South-western Alaska, where the
birds resort, and sell them for the purpose of
manufacturing egg albumen, a commercial article.
The destruction of these millions of eggs
every spring and summer is rapidly reducing
the number of game birds, and the flocks
every year grow smaller and smaller. Senator
Mitchell, of Oregon, introduced a bill at the
last session of Congress for the protection of these
game birds, but of course it did not come to vote,
and it probably never will. The game birds
will share the fate of the four-footed game; grow
fewer every year, and finally disappear altogether.</p>

<p>“When one remembers that thirty years ago
the skies were almost darkened by flights of
pigeons across Indiana and Illinois, and that
branches of trees were broken by their weight
and numbers, and that the other day a wild-pigeon
shot in Southern Indiana was regarded
as rare a curiosity as a white blackbird, it can
be realized how rapidly game birds are disappearing.
The game birds which are not migratory
are also hunted down in spite of game laws, and
every year grow scarcer and dearer in the markets.
If nothing is done to protect (more effectually)
there will soon be an end of game birds.
The greed of gain will end their existence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the birds in Ohio and the North-west,
the wild pigeon was by far the most numerous.
Those who have witnessed their flight, from early
morn until approaching night, all going in one
direction, without cessation for a number of consecutive
days, were ready to believe pigeons were
as the sands of the sea, innumerable, and could
never be exhausted. But, alas! inventions came,
the foes of bird-life: railroads and telegraphs.
And for many years, winter and summer, the
pigeon was traced, pursued, netted and trapped,
at feeding places, by gangs of pot-hunters, keeping
tons of dead birds all the time in transit to
the large cities. Year after year, from coast to
coast, this bird was followed, invading the breeding
places and destroying the young and old,
until the wild pigeon now exists in history, and
may be seen mounted by the taxidermist.</p>

<p>The birds that are not game, the women in
their vanity and thoughtlessness are rapidly destroying
those having an attractive plumage, and
millions of humming-birds, orioles, bluebirds,
starlings, indigo-birds, redstarts, redbirds, and
many others, are annually slaughtered to gratify
an <em>inhuman</em> and uncivilized fashion. For more
than ten years this destruction has been increasing,
and birds are diminishing in this and other
countries until extermination is near at hand.
Jules Forest says of the bird of paradise: “They
are so industriously hunted that the males are
not permitted to reach full maturity, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
birds which now flood the market are for the
most part young ones, still clothed in their first,
plumage, which lacks the brilliancy displayed in
the older bird, and are consequently of small
commercial value.” As to the tuft of delicate
plumes which are so much in demand by milliners,
and sold by them as real, are often mixed
with ospray tips, which, to the shame of womanhood,
have so long been in fashion and are still
used. I may state on trustworthy authority, that
“during the last season one warehouse alone has
disposed of no less than sixty thousand dozen of
these mixed sprays.” And the question comes:
Is there no way to stop it? Must bird-slaughter
go on to gratify a weak and cruel vanity, that
should be met not only with public scorn, but
also by the strong arm of the law, to reach the
possessor or the hat, as it does the fisherman and
his net or the hunter and his gun.</p>

<p>As the country became partially settled and
the larger game supply diminished by unseasonable
killing, clubs of squirrel hunters organized
and laws wore enacted protecting beasts and
birds with a close season. The good, the social
and intelligent, became members for what there
was in it. These clubs entertained no secrets,
and did not pattern after any of the ancient orders
with which the United States appear overblessed,
nor were they given to boasting of their
pedigrees. No one ever claimed King Solomon
was “the father and founder,” although he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
might have been; and members were satisfied
and sanguine that Mr. Nimrod, the mighty
hunter, for a <em>saint</em>, was in morals as good as any
of them.</p>

<p>These clubs had also many improvements over
ordinary societies. A candidate for membership
was not obliged to ride a goat to get in, nor with
bandaged eyes go down into a dangerous pit to
search for the tables of stone that Moses brought
home the ten commandments on. Neither had
the clubs any use for a catechism of secret signs
to let the brethren know when a member had
been guilty of something unwelcome to society,
and needed assistance. They were all Squirrel
Hunters, and members recognized each other by
the absence of society pins and want of superlative
adjectives at the front end of their names.
The only thing recorded in which these clubs resembled
any other order or society was in having
a great many glorious banquets. They cultivated
the social and democratic principles, owing
allegiance nowhere, to no one or any thing, but
the government and country covered by the
American flag.</p>

<p>The objects of these clubs were the study of
natural history and to secure and enforce all
laws for the preservation of game beasts and
birds, as well as the summer songsters that give
life and happiness to forest and field.</p>

<p>These clubs labored hard to enforce legislative
enactments against pot-hunting and thoughtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
destruction of birds, but found it more difficult
to capture the violator and public opinion than
to subdue British and Indians or frighten an
army. People generally had embraced the idea
that birds, beasts and trees could never become
seriously decimated, and it was useless to offer
them protection, which made it troublesome to
obtain a verdict against offenders by either judge
or jury. The motives of such prosecutions were
generally misconstrued, or plaintiffs made subjects
of sport or ridicule.</p>

<p>The following is taken from the records and
proceedings of one of the earliest organized and
most worthy game clubs in Ohio. It appears
the offender was a lawyer, who enjoyed fine
grounds and an elegant garden, and amused himself
shooting little birds that came to share his
bounty, or obtain a pittance by way of interest
for the good they had by nature rendered. The
club gave the lawyer notice and request to desist
such cruelty, or it might become necessary to call
the attention of the officers of the law to the
matter.</p>

<p>To this the club received the following reply,
worthy of preservation for its wit, humor, and
literary ability:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<em>To N&mdash;&mdash; E&mdash;&mdash;, Secretary of Branch No. 3, Ohio
Game Club</em>:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Your esteemed favor of yesterday
has been received, and at an early date I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
hasten to reply, not knowing just what punishment
would await me should I fail to be prompt
in my responses. As to the ‘birds of various
kinds’ of which you speak, I move to amend in
order to make more specific and certain, by stating
what kind of birds, what number, when
killed, and by what means. If required to plead
to the general charge, I would enter a plea of
‘not guilty.’ Permit me to say that I only killed
birds of <em>prey</em>, and I only <em>pray</em> that I may kill
more of them. I always bury all I kill; I <em>berry</em>
them before I kill them, and <em>bury</em> them afterwards.</p>

<p>“I am exceedingly sorry that my fancied misdeeds
have rendered necessary a special meeting
of the ‘club,’ or to have been the innocent occasion
of the least trouble to either the officers or
members of that useful and ornamental body.
Be kind enough to say, with my compliments, to
the association of which you have the honor to
be secretary, that the doors of the Temple of
Justice, like ‘the glorious gates of the gospel of
grace,’ stand open night and day, and the ‘club’
will please consider itself invited to enter and
become ‘involved in the intricate meshes of the
law.’</p>

<p>“Allow me further to say that I expect tomorrow
morning to be on my premises, near the city,
engaged in my usual and ordinary amusement of
destroying birds of prey; and as it is the ‘early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
bird that catches the worm.’ I would suggest to
members of your valuable association, through
their secretary, that they meet at an early hour,
say half-past five in the morning, either at Dodson’s
store or at the well-known grocery stand of
John L. King, and proceed in a body, in full uniform,
to the premises alluded to in your correspondence.
It might be well to have music, and
march to the tune of ‘Listen to the Mockingbird,’
or such other appropriate music as your
orchestra may select.</p>

<p>“One other suggestion: I am constitutionally
and proverbially careless in the handling of firearms,
and it may be well to make that statement
to the members of your organization, so that
should a stray shot fall wide of the mark at
which it was aimed, they may feel a sense of
security behind such intrenchments as nature or
art shall have provided. Ice-water and sponges
will be furnished free to each and every member
who attends, but no gin cocktails will be given.</p>

<p class="il2">“Very truly yours, H&mdash;&mdash;.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems an unanswered question, how the natives
preserved the forests from fires, and maintained
the numerical strength of the species of
animals on which they subsisted. The countries
in which Indians have been found subsisting by
hunting, are known to have forests undisturbed
by fires for thousands of years, and containing a
full complement of all kinds of game indigenous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
to the locality. This country, at the time surrendered,
was fully endowed with all the gifts of
nature. <a id="Ref_219"></a>Love had preserved the forests from fires,
protected the game beasts and birds, and shown
natural wisdom enough not to kill the goose to
obtain the golden egg.</p>

<p>How these wise results were accomplished are
unknown to civilization. But it can be stated as
a fact, new countries have never suffered from
forest fires or the destruction of their game at
the hands of the Indian hunter. Even in limited
and crowded reservations he manages to preserve
the forests, and in some way to keep on hand a
supply of animals to the full extent the conditions
of nature will admit. The instinct to kill
no more than enough for present use, though he
may suffer from hunger the next day, probably
has had a favorable influence on game and its
preservation.</p>

<p>While practically a resident of an unsettled
Indian country (the northern portion of Iowa Territory),
in 1845, it was noticeable that there existed
no lack of game, nor variety, although
pretty densely populated with Winnebagoes,
Sioux and Fox Indian, who derived their meat
chiefly from the yearly increase of game furnished
within a limited territory.</p>

<p>Soon after the close of the treaty with those
tribes, made by General Dodge in the summer of
1845, at Fort Atkinson, the writer, with a friend,
passed through the hunting grounds for more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
than one hundred miles, and saw a number of
large flocks of wild turkey and larger game in
abundance. We followed the deep-cut channel
of the romantic Turkey river for sixty miles in
the Indian country, and during this ride the
young birds were seen flying from bluff to bluff,
crossing the river on their daily round in search
of food.</p>

<p>And we believe it is true: No game laws enacted
by white man can prove as effective in the
protection of game as those enforced by Indian
hunters. The red man never scares game from
the region in which he hunts. He steals upon the
deer or wild turkeys with the soft tread of moccasined
feet, and dressed in accord with the tints
and tones of plain and forest, the animals are
satisfied with trying to avoid his presence without
quitting the region selected as their home.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Turkey River, Iowa, 1845.</p></div>
</div>

<p>An old-time hunter in the West makes the
statement that ever since the general adoption by
Indians of firearms for hunting, it has not been
found that game has diminished in regions where
the white man is an infrequent visitor. It is
when white hunters invade their haunts, with
the tread of booted feet, their clothes alien to surrounding
nature and with dogs and bluster, that
all kinds of game are bound to be killed or driven
away. And as Sir Samuel Baker, the explorer,
asserts of African game and predatory creatures:
“Animals can endure traps, pitfalls, fire, and
every savage method of hunting, but firearms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
may be used to clear them out from extensive
districts.” Still, under prudent use known to
Indians only, game of our forests and plains may
be preserved indefinitely and in abundance of all
kinds.</p>

<p>“Individual avarice and corporate greed will
soon cause all the mineral lands to be stripped of
their forests.... Wealthy companies have
been organized, mills erected, and the most valuable
timber accessible is being rapidly cut off.
That which is every one’s property is no one’s care,
and extravagance and waste are the natural consequence
of negligent legislation.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The increasing destruction of the timber belts
of this country is certainly enough to alarm the
nation. The Census Office prepared for distribution
a bulletin bearing upon this subject for the
consideration of the people of the United States.
The lumber production&mdash;which means tree destruction&mdash;in
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan
in the last decade increased twenty-nine per
cent in quantity and seventy-five per cent in
value, and according to the eleventh (last) census,
the capital invested in the milling business in the
three states named shows an increase of one hundred
and fifty-seven million five hundred and
thirty-one thousand dollars.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<p>United States Senator Henry M. Rice, who
spent considerable time in Northern Minnesota
treating with the Indians, says: “This timber
cutting is going on for fifty miles up the Baudette,
North and South Fork rivers, and that the Indians
declare that it has been going on for more
than a dozen years by Canadian lumbermen.”
It is stated on good authority that more than two
hundred million feet were floated through the
Lake of the Woods in 1894. And Senator Rice
says: “So bold have these timber robbers become
that they have built dams in the tributary
streams for the purpose of backing up the water
and floating out their logs.”</p>

<p>When these extensive thieving operations were
conveyed to the authorities, one lone “timber inspector”
was sent up in this vast district and
made his headquarters in the wilderness one hundred
and fifty miles from the nearest point from
which he could obtain any assistance, and it is
generally believed, in Minnesota, that the “timber
inspector” failed to “hold up” several thousand
Canadian robbers, who were engaged in
floating American timber across the line and
filling their pockets with gold.</p>

<p>The Minneapolis Journal has done much to
call the attention of the people of that state,
and the Nation, to the unparalleled destruction of
this greatest gift of nature, and quite recently
says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The reservations which have been ceded by
the Chippewas in this state to the government
embrace the heaviest white pine forests now
available as a source of lumber supply. These
forests are largely contributory to the retention
of the moisture which feeds the streams and
lakes that make the sources of the Mississippi
river.</p>

<p>“Already there is much said about the great
commercial value of these pine lands, and there
is not the slightest doubt that as soon as the
region is opened by the government the work
of destruction will commence, which will speedily
lay bare the soil and subject it to the drying influences
of the sun and wind, or to the forest
fires, which will kill every young growth which
appears, and destroy even tree seed, which has
been borne there by the winds. The result
of this will be the diminution of the sources of
the supply of the Mississippi, which will be felt
by every water power company from Itasca to
Fort Snelling.</p>

<p>“These are grave consequences, and the question
is: Shall the denudation of this new region
be allowed to go on without some regulations
as to cutting and forest renewal? There
would seem to be a good opportunity to bring to
bear the world’s experience in forestry. This
reckless cutting and selling the forests will bring
temporary gain to the lumbermen, but will ultimately
destroy agriculture and water-power interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
as well as the healthful conditions of the
country.</p>

<p>“In France, whole communities were ruined by
the denudation of their lands; and obliged the
government to enter upon the work of restocking
this ruined section of country with
young trees at a cost of many millions of dollars;
all to regain what had been lost through
indifference. But how is it now? The region of
the Landes, which fifty years ago was the abandoned
country of little value, inhabited by a few
sickly shepherds, who wandered over the country
with their meager flocks, is now the most prosperous
part of France. It has been made so
by the planting of forests, and has now saw-mills,
charcoal kilns, turpentine works, thriving
towns, and fertile agricultural lands, and a growing
and increasing valuation, and the net gain
to the government by the expenditure amounts
to over two hundred million dollars.</p>

<p>“Not until the sheltering influence of trees has
disappeared, the climate made variable with
sharp and sudden changes of temperature, successions
of thaws and freezings; not until springs
and brooks become dry in summer, and a
failure of all kinds of crops and plants, does the
improvident ask or even wonder what the matter
is.</p>

<p>“<em>Every reserve of timber in this country ought to be
sacredly guarded by the government</em>, and timber
cutting be put under stringent regulations, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to the continued protection of the streams.
<em>Unless this is done the Mississippi river will surely
change its character.</em> It will become a shallow,
sluggish stream, unable to carry off impurities,
and useless for navigation or water-power. It
will not take very long to effect this change, if
the forests are destroyed in the northern part of
its source. A present gain in lumber will mean
very great injury to all other material interests.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A special from St. Paul says&mdash;“From Rainy
Lake to the Lake of the Woods, a distance of one
hundred and fifty miles, the entire country is
covered with a heavy growth of timber and is
mostly pine, and is totally uninhabited save by
scattering bands of Chippewa Indians. That
these two great lakes are connected by Rainy
Lake river, one of the finest navigable streams
in North America; and on which its branches
and the Lake of the Woods, no less than twenty
steamers and tugs ply from early spring to late
in the fall, conveying stolen timber from the
United States to Rat Portage, Keewatin, and even
to Winnipeg, where it is manufactured and sent
wherever a market can be found.</p>

<p>“Keewatin and Rat Portage are the centers of
the timber depredations and act as a base of supplies
for the depredators. Nearly all the numerous
fleets of steamers plying on the lake find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
their home in these two towns. The Dominion
Government considers its side of the line important
enough to demand a station at Hungry Hall,
on the Canadian side of the mouth of Rainy Lake
river, as well as at several other points between
the Red river of the North and the head of Lake
Superior, but the United States Government,
though knowing the amount of valuable timber
in the district desirable, has no port between St.
Vincent and Lake Superior.</p>

<p>“When it is realized that all this timber belongs
to the wards of the United States, the
Indians, or to the Government itself, it is hard to
see on what principle the states can so neglect
this great timber belt. Not a foot of this timber
can be sold or in any way disposed of until it has
been appraised and surveyed. And it was asked
that the Minnesota delegation in Congress take
steps at once to have Congress pass a measure
authorizing the placing of a revenue cutter on the
Lake of the Woods, and equipping two posts,
one near Rainy Lake, and the other directly
across from Hungry Hall, where one lone timber
inspector is supposed to be. But has any thing
been done? The State Senatorial Committee of
Minnesota, in an investigation of frauds against
the state, found the <em>timber pirates</em> responsible for
most all the calamities from fire which have befallen
the timber lands of the state. After stealing
millions of dollars worth of timber belonging
to the state, in order to cover the theft, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
started fires which have resulted in those terrible
losses of life and property. Firing the lands they
had fraudulently cleared in order to render the
measurement of stumpage impossible, and thereby
shut off any suits a commission might attempt to
bring against them. In putting the torch to the
‘toppings,’ every thing is destroyed&mdash;stumps,
young trees and frequently valuable timber, to
the amount of many million dollars.”</p>

<p>In all the pine belts in the western country
there is a loud demand by honest citizens, that
the manner of cutting timber be severely regulated.
It has been clearly shown from time to
time that this forest destruction in the United
States without restitution, is still going on at the
enormous rate of over ten million acres annually,
and must soon land the country in all the ills due
to forest famine.</p>

<p>Senator Paddock, of the Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry, reports that the United
States Government retains somewhat less than
seventy million acres of public domain, which
is designated as timber or woodland, mostly
situated on the slopes and crests of the western
mountain ranges. The above estimate may be
too low, but if not, the entire forests of the Government
are scarcely sufficient of themselves to supply
the vast demands of the country another decade.</p>

<p>In 1889, it was estimated that Idaho, Montana,
and Wyoming contained fifty-three thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
square miles of forest&mdash;Colorado and New Mexico,
thirty thousand; and that other portions of the
public domain were covered with large and valuable
belts, and of which the Hon. Secretary of
Agriculture says in his reports: “We are wasting
our forests, by axe, by fire, by pasturage, by
<em>neglect</em>. They are rapidly falling below the
amount required by industrial needs, by our
water supply, by our rivers, by our climate, by
our navigation and agriculture. It is high time
to <em>call a halt</em>. The devastation of the axe will
probably go on in the forests owned by private
parties. Other forms of devastation <em>can and should
be stopped by vigorous measures on the part of the
Government</em>.”</p>

<p>“<em>Our only hope</em>,” says Secretary Rusk, “<em>is to
save what forests we have still in public possession, ... not
allowing them to be cut except under
such conditions as will insure ample reproduction</em>.”</p>

<p>Six years have passed since the above important
declarations were made, still nothing has
been done to deter the thieves or ward off a
pending calamity.</p>

<p>For future forest supplies the people of the
United States must look to the general government
which controls the national domain, holds
the keys of the public treasury, and is responsible
for this source of national wealth.</p>

<p>From various authentic sources, it is stated of
the once-timbered countries in Southern Europe,
Northern Africa and from the Russian Empire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
South India, which are now uninhabited barren
wastes, has been due to changes of climate, soil
and water-fall, from the loss of forests. The
once fertile valleys of Syria, with springs and
brooks, and fields of grain and grass, are as
parched and dry, and water as scarce as it is on
the desert or staked plains&mdash;summer suns have
scorched the unprotected soil&mdash;hot winds absorbed
the last vestige of moisture&mdash;the air is filled with
clouds of loose dust, and the naked mountains
stand as monuments of departed glory, of the
Roman provinces from the Caucasus to the
archipelago.</p>

<p>Look at the wasted peninsulas of Southern
Europe. What has reduced to skeletons the inhabitants
of the garden lands of the nations of
classic antiquity? Greece has become a barren
rock, and Sicily, “the pearl of the Mediterranean,”
a hospital of famine, typhus and purulent
ophthalmia!</p>

<p>Has not the desolation in each been due to
one and the same cause?&mdash;the destruction of
forests.</p>

<p>Why then should history repeat itself on this
subject in America?</p>

<p>As early as 1832, the wisdom of Mehemet Ali
saw the cause of the poverty and distress, and applied
the only remedy that ever has or ever will
restore life-sustaining conditions, and commenced
re-establishing forests on the sand plains of upper
Egypt&mdash;Abyssinia and the slopes of the mountains&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the rate of one hundred thousand acres
annually.</p>

<p>Trees, like beasts and birds, at one time existed
in such vast and apparently incalculable
numbers that it seemed improbable their presence
could be diminished sufficiently to give them
importance or value. To have trees removed by
any means was looked upon by the owner of the
soil as a favor; and those having charge of the
public domain felt pretty much the same way.
But to the man of three-score and ten years it is
astonishing how soon the great forests have disappeared,
or become so valuable and inviting as
to tempt the mercenary to steal and the rewarded
public official to permit. Trees have a value to
every form of life&mdash;a value above the lumber
they may produce or the moneyed wealth they
may bring the possessor. It has for thousands
of years undergone practical demonstration that
forests determine the climatic conditions of any
given country, and for this reason forests form
an indispensable basis for agriculture, manufacture
and commercial industry. They also bear a
near relation to the health, wealth and prosperity
of a nation.</p>

<p>These facts being so universally admitted, it
may seem strange that a government which has
from its inception been so interested in the welfare
of its subjects, and which has assisted and
encouraged in various ways so many sources of
wealth and industry, should have overlooked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
forests, from which the nation is drawing larger
amounts than from all other natural sources
combined.</p>

<p>The government has ever been devoted to the
interests of agriculture and manufacturing; and
by premiums, by exemptions, by protections, by
model farms, by grants, by bounties, by patent
rights, by technical schools, and by introduction
of superior animals and improved machinery, has
fostered well these industries. It has not been at
fault, either, in donating large sums in the construction
of canals and railroads and for the improvement
of rivers and harbors. It has even
taken an interest in the clam and oyster, and has
stocked the rivers and lakes with young fish, that
the devastation of these natural sources of wealth
may be compensated thereby, and perpetuated as
a national trust; while the springs and brooks and
streams, the climatic causes of disease, the necessary
conditions for national wealth and national
health&mdash;in a word, the importance of forests
for the nation, for the land, for agriculture,
for the perpetuation of rivers&mdash;has received little
or no official recognition. Few persons are
so destitute of foresight as not to see that the
fires and thieves, and increasing consumption, if
continued at the present rate, can not fail to
make this a treeless waste, a desolate, uninhabitable
country, at no very distant date. Is there
no way by which the remaining beasts and birds
and trees can be preserved? Must the civilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of the North-west permit the pirates of destruction
to take and hold possession of all its
natural endowments? The clubs have been after
the pot-hunter with legal enactments, and have
crippled, but never as yet have they succeeded in
exterminating him. He is still destroying the
remnants of game, and is at large in the public
domain, seeking something to devour.</p>

<p>The general government should no longer postpone
a definition of its policy regarding <em>forests</em>,
<em>rivers</em>, and its <em>millions of acres of arid lands</em>. The
American people have been slow to realize the
drifting of this country toward a forest famine
and its destructive results. On the subject of
forestry, until recently, representatives have been
politically dumb, and, no doubt, would have remained
so much longer had it not been for the
inspiration of a few men. In January, 1872, ex-Secretary
Morton presented a resolution before
the Agricultural Society of Nebraska to set apart
one day in each year and consecrate it to planting
trees. This day was christened “Arbor Day,”
and is now observed by law and proclamation in
thirty-one states; has entered our schools and
colleges, and forestry forms part of the curriculum.</p>

<p>Wherever Arbor-Day has been observed it has
awakened a sense of inquiry; has taught the
children the names, nature, and usefulness of
trees, with a lasting admiration and love for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
them. From the influences of Arbor-Day, Nebraska
has more than a million acres of planted
forests, and Minnesota, Kansas, Iowa, Wisconsin,
and other Western States fast following the
good example. With laws, plantings, and premiums;
with books, schools, and colleges; with
the hearts of workers in it, forestry has built up
a healthy public sentiment that must be felt.
The Eastern States are also awake and glistening
with law officers to protect their woods from fires
and thieves; and by large premiums and exemptions
from taxation, have greatly promoted the
interest of forestry in their respective states.</p>

<p>Even the state that sold her birth-right&mdash;one
hundred and fifty billion feet of standing forest
for nine hundred million dollars&mdash;is not without
influence for good. All these noble acts of the
states and of the people will be heard in time;
for the government of the nation is not given to
disregard the will of the people, and has ever
shown a readiness to take the front and co-operate
with the states in every good work. But
there is something more required of a government&mdash;the
representatives of the people must
do more than simply respond to petitions. In a
free republican government the people are both
sovereigns and wards, and they expect those who
assume legislative and executive powers of the
nation to understand political economy sufficiently
to manage correctly the finances and the natural
wealth of the nation with intelligence and superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
wisdom. And in this direction it would
certainly prove a most laudable act to withdraw
from sale or entry for a long period, if not perpetually,
<em>all</em> remaining forests and all arid lands
where the rain-fall is below twenty inches, and
place the same under the management of the
Secretary of Agriculture, with ample powers and
appropriations to build up a grand system of
forestry, surpassing in extent and wealth all similar
institutions belonging to the monarchies of
Europe combined.</p>

<p>Governor J. J. Stevens, in his final report of
surveys for a railroad across the Rocky Mountains,
called the attention of the government, in 1855,
to the arid lands west of the Missouri river, between
parallels forty degrees and forty-nine north
latitude. He compared it in extent, climate,
rain-fall, and other features, to the Steppes, which
occupies about one-fifth of the Russian Empire,
and quotes the “Commentaries of the Productive
Sources of Russia” to sustain his statements:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Among other peculiarities of the Steppes a
very prominent and distinctive one is the absence
of timber, ... and opinions differ greatly
as to the possibility of wooding it anew.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Since 1855, the Russian Government has arrived
at one conclusion, and adopted a policy of
reforesting this two hundred and forty thousand
square miles worthy of imitation.</p>

<p>Let the Government of the United States do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
as Russia has been doing, and the steppes from
the Missouri river to the mountains will be
reclaimed and made to “blossom as the rose.”
According to geological surveys there are seven
hundred and fifty million acres of arid, treeless
lands, incapable of successful cultivation without
irrigation&mdash;but where trees can be grown&mdash;for experiments
have shown that trees will grow where
the rain-fall is insufficient for grain or grass.</p>

<p>According to J. W. Powell, director of the
United States Geological Survey, on the water
supply in the arid regions, it would seem if all the
water run off could be impounded and appropriated
to irrigation it would be insufficient to supply
one-tenth of the arid districts. And it might
be asked if the arid land in the Dakotas, Montana,
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Nevada,
California, New Mexico, Texas, Kansas, Colorado,
Wyoming, Nebraska, and Indian Territory,
only about “one hundred million acres” can be
irrigated and made productive, what is to be
done with the remaining six hundred and fifty
million acres?</p>

<p>Could the area entire, or any part of the arid
lands be made productive on the most economic
plan yet devised by irrigation enterprise in this
country, the cost of such lands and their products
could never become profitably utilized in commerce
so long as the vast area of cheap productive
soil of the United States, or even that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
North-west lies out doors, ready to receive the
showers of Heaven.</p>

<p>When we recount the miseries and misfortunes
of the eight hundred million people that meagerly
subsist on the products of irrigated, treeless
lands, it makes an irresistible hope that the
government of this nation may never be induced by
ingenious descriptions of co-operative systems of
economics, nor less perceptible but more powerful
influences of <em>speculators in western water-ways</em>, to
adopt a policy that will make any part of this
country and nation, a Spain, a China, an India,
or an Egypt, for want of forests.</p>

<p>Every country should have a just proportion of
the total area in timber to make it healthful and
productive. It is far better to have a portion in
timber than to have all the country clothed with
herds or covered with corn. It is the order of
nature, the necessity of civilization, and the only
true basis for a happy, powerful and independent
population.</p>

<p>As the source for national revenue, it is an interest
ranking first in importance, even in dollars
and cents; and certainly, if for no other reason
than for the wealth there is in it, the subject demands
the attention of the government sufficiently
to enforce protection and perpetuation.
Every year it comes&mdash;“Once more the forests of
the far west are aflame,” and it is not only the
loss in money, but such sections of country are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
ruined for all purposes beyond the power of
generations to repair.</p>

<p>It may seem expensive to maintain an army of
officers and employes to protect and perpetuate
the forests of the public domain. But notwithstanding
it would require large appropriations,
it would repay the outlay many thousand times
in national wealth, for this great army would not
be idlers. Nothing short of an organized department
of forestry can protect and maintain this
source of national wealth. The appropriation
for this department in France has been five million
dollars, and is returned with good interest.</p>

<p>Austria, not larger in extent of territory than the
States of Illinois and Iowa combined, maintains
thirty-two thousand forestry officers or employees
and receives a large net income from this source;
and reports show that Germany has an annual income
of fifty-seven million dollars from an area of
thirty-three million acres of timber, and it is estimated
that no more is harvested each year than is
compensated by growth and reoccupation of wasted
ground. For, forest preservation does not mean
that trees shall not be cut down, but that they
shall be used, while all the conditions for their
reproduction are steadily maintained from year
to year, using if necessary, an amount equal to
the production by growth. This requires planting,
and tree-planting and forestry mean labor in
this country as it does in Europe. The United
States without Alaska, is, I believe, about nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
times larger in area than Germany, and to be
proportionately equal with this foreign power,
the United States should have under control
of the government an area of <em>six hundred million
acres as a reservation for timber to supply the public
necessities of the near future</em>. And it should be
done without delay; the arid lands and forests
along the streams and lakes that make the
sources of the Mississippi and other navigable
streams, should be dedicated forever to the cultivation
of timber.</p>

<p>And here the labor question is solved. Every
government that is able to sustain itself, must
have something for idle hands to do. The increasing
supply of labor has alarmed many thinking
people. <em>Labor is wealth</em>, but how can all find
employment? Which means <em>bread</em>. And various
suggestions have been made simply to furnish
<em>subsistence</em>. But in forestry there is something
better&mdash;a necessity, a demand for labor, giving
profitable employment to a vastly greater number
than any other public necessity; for the labors
of a department or bureau of this kind
would be as immense as indispensable; and could
end only with the end of the race.</p>

<p>A forest of six hundred million acres, thoroughly
organized and officered under the Secretary
of Agriculture, would sink the post-office
department and its patronage into insignificance,
and would be the brightest star in the civil service
solar system to those who elect a life in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
service of the country. But this is not all&mdash;it
would make the climate more healthful, the rain-fall
more regular and abundant, the soil more
productive, and in due time would exceed all
other sources of revenue combined.</p>

<p>The immensity of the consumption of forest
supplies can not be measured accurately; but
some idea can be formed of its vastness, when it
is known that the one hundred and eighty-seven
thousand miles of railroads and one hundred and
thirty-seven thousand miles of telegraph lines in
this country consume each year the annual growth
or a forest equal to <em>one hundred and fifty million acres</em>.
And nothing short of a large area of well-managed
forest will prove adequate to <em>future</em> demands.
What else can the nation expect when
at present statistics show the annual consumption,
or crop, exceeds in value seven hundred
million dollars?</p>

<p>This is more than the yield of all the gold-mines
and silver-mines, coal, iron, copper, lead,
and zinc combined; and if these are added to the
value of all the steamboats, sailing vessels, canal-boats,
flat-boats, and barges in American
waters, the sum would be still less than the value
of the forest crop by an amount sufficient to purchase
at cost of construction all the canals, all the
telegraph and telephone lines in the United States.
The value of the forest income exceeds the gross
income of all the railroads and transportation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
lines, and is an interest ranking in importance
far above all others in the United States.</p>

<p>If this country ever becomes a Dalmatia&mdash;changed
from a healthful, fruitful and salubrious
habitation to a sterile, sickly waste, with decayed
cities and crumbling greatness, history will not
say “the Romans did it.”</p>

<p>Man should ever remember prevention is better
than cure. The worst of evils is prevented
by the removal of the cause. And when the
apathy and improvidence which now threaten
the destiny of a rich and prosperous nation are removed,
then, and not till then, can it truly be
said that the lost Paradise of the Eastern Continent
has been regained in the New World of
the West. The people should understand, also,
the inspired influences of living forests&mdash;trees&mdash;those
musical mutes, upon those who breathe their
sweet ennobling influence.</p>

<p>The finest agricultural climate, perhaps, in the
world, fell to the lot of Ohio. But this state will
soon be obliged to do something to offset the destruction
that is still going on with the little groves.
When it came into the Union, it presented the
grandest unbroken forest of forty-one thousand
square miles that was ever beheld on this continent.
A forest interspersed with hills and valleys,
springs, brooks, and rivers; with a soil most
inviting to the aspirations of agriculture.</p>

<p>The natural conditions of things were such
that the possessors of this inheritance soon desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
occupation of the soil, and looked upon its
trees with less favor than they did upon those
who disputed their titles with the tomahawk.
Indians could be induced to move out of the way,
but trees were all disposed to stand their ground
and take the consequences. Both were considered
too numerous for easy advancement of
civilization, and in the contest both got the worst
of it.</p>

<p>Forests may flourish independent of agriculture,
but the latter can not prosper without the
former. This was not so evident, however, to
the early inhabitant, who felt he had thrust upon
him more than his share of perpetual shade, and
every owner and occupant of the soil combined
with his neighbor in a warfare of destruction upon
trees, and millions, the best of their kind ever
produced were killed by cutting a circle around
the trunk and left to decay. These deadenings
were to be seen all over the country, as fast and
as far as settlements were made or contemplated.
And now, in less than a hundred years, more
than eighty per cent. of this great forest has disappeared,
and only small clumps in agricultural
sections can be seen in any part of the state.</p>

<p>The older trees that occupied their places in
these remnants of woods have nearly all fallen
by the hand of the axman, and the younger
growths are being appropriated for various purposes,
greatly in excess of possible reproduction
to the remaining stock; and the time is not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
distant, if things continue without change for the
better, when the salubrious climate, with summer
showers and productive soil, will become
changed to one of uncertainty. The entire North-west
is now on the very border of forest limit.
Still thousands of portable saw-mills are moving
over the states, destroying the remaining needful
trees, and the rural districts will discover, when
too late, that private interest is insufficient to
protect forest lands in quantity enough to maintain
climatic and sanitary influences without the
aid of state government.</p>

<p>Some years ago the legislature of Ohio passed
a law, now in force, which lost the state many
millions of growing forest trees that stood on the
public grounds. The act reads: “Supervisors
shall cut down <em>all bushes</em> growing within any
county or township highway, the same to be done
within the months of July and August of each
year.” Thus a clean sweep was made of every
tree, bush and plant, as the word “bushes” was
legally defined to mean places “abounding in
trees and shrubs.” Trees of all kinds, sizes and
ages, bordering and within the legal limits of the
highways, met their doom under this act. And
every growing scion that dared since to raise its
head along the border lines of Ohio roads has
met a similar fate in the months of July and
August of each year.</p>

<p>If laws can be enforced to destroy trees along
the borders of public highways, it is reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to suppose laws may be made and enforced to restore
and protect them in such locations. Ohio
has approximately forty thousand miles of good
public highways and ways that could well subserve
the use of trees along their borders, at sufficient
distances to give them room and opportunity
to grow. A tree on either side at thirty
feet distant would make in the aggregate a forest
of ordinary distribution of several million trees,
that could be owned, cultivated and protected by
law. At the same time, an act of this kind
would maintain the lawful width of roads and
prevent encroachments by adjoining land-owners,
and make all highways and byways avenues of
beauty, health and pleasure.</p>

<p>A fraction of a mill added to the tax assessment
as a “forestry fund,” and expended in
planting and protecting trees, would soon accomplish
the work. Trees similarly arranged along
railroads, canals and water-courses, and around
district school-houses, with a law exempting from
taxation all lands devoted exclusively to woods,
would, in the combination, form an important
factor in preserving the true ratio of timber to
farming lands, the humidity of the atmosphere,
and the healthful condition of the country.</p>

<p>Trees are to be prized for many reasons, and
admired for their longevity. There is, perhaps,
no limit to the life of a tree. No inquest has
ever rendered a verdict “<em>caused by old age</em>.”
They are not dependent upon the heart for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
systemic vitality. The potency of the living
principle lies near the periphery and most distant
roots and branches from the surface of the
ground; and grow on and on, subject only to
accidents that may end life. The expression may
have seemed extravagant for even an enthusiast,
when that slip from a cypress tree of Ceylon
was planted, to say it would “<em>flourish and be green
forever</em>.” It is now the historical and sacred
Bo-tree of two thousand one hundred and eighty-three
years, and still green and growing.</p>

<p>While the Bo-tree is perhaps the oldest tree
found in human records, it is not likely by any
means, that it stands at the head in longevity.
For trees keep their own books, and write their
own history, in which may be found an account
of passing years, from the beginning to the ending
of life&mdash;a true autobiography&mdash;the eucalyptus
of Senegal, the chestnuts at Mount Ætna,
the oaks of Windsor, the yews at Fountain
Abbey, the olives in the Garden of Gethsemane,
or the mammoth trees in California are much
older, making it quite probable that some of the
first seedlings that grew after the last remodeling
of the earth took place, are still green and
growing.</p>

</div>

<p>It is stated on good authority that one of those
ancient Jumbos blown down at Sequoia Park,
California, was forty-one feet in diameter and
showed six thousand, one hundred and twenty-six
annual rings, or yearly growths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>In the explorations and surveys, under act of
Congress, 1853 and 1854, Dr. J. M. Bigelow, in
his report says: “It required five men twenty-two
days,” with pump augers, to get one of these
Sequoia Gigantea down&mdash;costing for labor at California
prices, $550. “A short distance from this
tree was another of larger dimensions, which,
apparently, had been overthrown by an <em>accident</em>
some forty or fifty years ago.... The
trunk was three hundred feet in length; the top
broken off, and by some agency (probably fire)
was destroyed. At the distance of three hundred
feet from the butt, the trunk was forty feet in
circumference, or more than twelve feet in diameter, ... proving
to a degree of moral
certainty that the tree, when standing alive,
must have attained the height of four hundred
and fifty or five hundred feet!</p>

<p>“At the butt it is one hundred and ten feet in circumference,
or about thirty-six feet in diameter.
On the bark, quite a soil had accumulated, on
which considerable-sized shrubs were growing.
Of these I collected specimens of currants and
gooseberries on its body, from bushes elevated
twenty-two feet from the ground.”</p>

<p>Ohio abounded in large forest trees of many
varieties&mdash;the sycamore, oak, poplars, chestnut,
black walnut, etc. The writer made partial notes
at the time, of a large yellow poplar that was
cut down in 1844, and taken to a saw mill, receiving
from it over eleven thousand feet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
lumber, which was sold at the mill for one hundred
and two dollars. The tree was large at the
base, measuring three feet above the ground,
forty feet in circumference. The axemen built
a scaffold twelve feet in height to stand upon,
and by means of the axe and saw, they made a
stump fifteen feet in height. Some distance
above this point the center was decayed and
when down, ten feet was discovered as unsuitable
for boards. Four sound logs of ten feet each
were cut below the two branches, and each
branch made also a good saw-log. The four logs
cut from the trunk of the tree were, on the
average over seven feet in diameter, and were
obliged to be quartered in order to handle them,
and consequently there was more than ordinary
waste at the mill, as well as where the tree
stood. The outside appearance of the tree bore
no evidence of decay and those who had taken
the contract to cut it down were greatly rejoiced
to find over four feet of the diameter useless as
support.</p>

<p>Many coon-hunters had followed tracks in snow
for miles to bring up at this tree, which was selected
for safety or other <em>instinctive reason</em>;
probably from its long standing it became a
favorite resort or stopping place for traveling
raccoons. A portion of both main branches of
the tree was hollow. One was occupied by
coons and the other by “the little busy bee.”
But neither the bee-hunters nor hunter for coons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
could be induced to cut the tree for what it contained,
and for forty years it defied the axemen
of the surrounding settlement.</p>

<p>Another of the first crop of trees that has
passed away without mention is a sycamore
that stood on the banks of the Scioto, in Pickaway
county. It became quite noted and familiar
to generations of hunters, who used the interior
for camping purposes on hunting excursions
for nearly half a century. It was also known
and visited by others, from the fact, in 1872, a
newly married couple commenced housekeeping
in its spacious quarters, and enjoyed the seclusion
amidst a forest of other mammoth trees. July
4, 1855, the dimensions of this sycamore were
taken, which showed&mdash;Circumference three feet
above ground, forty-five feet, and diameter of the
hollow chamber, fourteen feet; door-way, three
feet wide at base, terminating in a point seven
feet above.</p>

<p>The large trees existed in abundance in many
portions of the state, showing ages of four to
five hundred years. Trees sometimes are found
in such close proximity as to be termed “wedded,”
as those shown in the <a href="#Ref_250">following page</a>, which are
near the line of the towing path of the canal in
Miami county&mdash;an elm and sycamore&mdash;girt six
feet from the ground measures twenty-four feet.</p>

<p>One of the surveys of the Military District, in
Pickaway county, is known as the “Seven Oaks.”
In 1793, while Nathaniel Massie was making surveying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
tours in the country yet covered by hostile
Indians, his assistant, Duncan McArthur, ran
around a tract located in Pickaway county, covered
it with warrants, and named it, “The Seven
Oaks.” The trees were said to be large one hundred
years ago and still growing. From measurements
made June 21, 1895, the circumference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
of the main undivided trunk, three feet from the
ground measured twenty-five feet ten inches;
height of common trunk, three feet six inches. At
the top of the common trunk is an opening eighteen
inches wide into a circular inclosure, with a
floor thirty-six inches in diameter, formed by
main trunk and surrounding trees. The four trees,
forming the west and north portions of the circle,
remain united for ten feet, while those forming
the south and eastern portion separate at six feet
from the ground. Each of the seven trees
is one hundred feet in height, and measures a
little over eight feet in circumference at bisections.</p>

<p>Great trees and great men and women are too
numerous to obtain more than a mention. Every
thing in Ohio has shown a tendency to superiority.
It may seem almost fabulous, though true,
a grape-vine near Frankfort, in Ross county, was
cut down in 1853 that measured sixteen feet in
circumference, ten feet from the ground; twenty
feet up it divided into three branches, each measuring
eight feet in circumference; height, seventy-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>

feet; and when cut up made eight cords of fire-wood.</p>

<p>It has been shown by actual measurements
that the “big elm” of Walnut street, Chillicothe,
Ohio, is much larger than the famous Boston
elm, or any one at Cambridge, New Haven, or
the great tree at Wethersfield. The Chillicothe
elm measures twenty-eight feet six inches in circumference
three feet above ground, with boughs
covering an area of fifty-five square rods. As
late as 1840 the remnants of this olden forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
crop could be numbered by the dozen on an area
of almost any square mile of woods. They were
left because it meant work to get them off their
pre-emption claim. But an advance in lumber
and improvements soon diminished the number
having a lumber value, leaving those unfitted for
boards to the destruction of campfires and girdling,
or to be utilized as houses of various kinds and
purposes. A large, hollow sycamore in Pike
county, near Waverly, made a commodious
blacksmith shop and horse-shoeing establishment
for many years.</p>

<p>“The Logan Elm” is the most interesting historic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
tree in Ohio, testifying of thrilling incidents
in colonial times&mdash;military achievements of
Lord Dunmore, unsurpassed ability of the red
man, and the trying period of the earliest pioneers&mdash;each
giving great interest to the spot
where stands this living monument.</p>

<p>During the fall of 1774 Lord Dunmore fitted
out an expedition of three thousand men, hoping
to destroy the Indians and their numerous towns
along the Scioto valley. His army moved westward
in two sections. The larger division, commanded
by Dunmore in person, crossed the
mountains by way of the Cumberland Gap, and
arrived at the Ohio river near where Wheeling
now stands, and the smaller corps, under command
of Colonel Andrew Lewis, followed the
Kanawha to its confluence. Before reaching the
villages of the plains and along the borders of the
Scioto river, in Pickaway county, the divisions
had planned to form a junction.</p>

<p>Colonel Lewis arrived on the Ohio river at the
point designated October 6th, and encamped on
the grounds now occupied by the town of Point
Pleasant, awaiting dispatches from Lord Dunmore.
After remaining three days without intrenchments
or other works of defense, he was,
on the 10th, attacked early in the morning by
one thousand chosen braves of the tribes belonging
to the confederacy, under the great chieftain,
“Cornstalk,” hoping to destroy his enemies before
they should have an opportunity to unite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
their forces. The battle lasted all day and ended
with the cover of night. The Indians felt they
received the greater disaster, having two hundred
and thirty-three killed and severely wounded.
Here Colonel Charles Lewis lost his life, with
the lives of half of the commissioned officers.</p>

<p>Chief Cornstalk felt the failure, and to save
the towns and people of the Scioto valley, something
must be done immediately, and hurried to
Lord Dunmore with petitions for peace. Previous
to this, and in ignorance of the bloody battle,
Dunmore had transmitted orders to Lewis to
move on and enter the borders of the enemy’s
country on the Scioto.</p>

<p>Elated with the idea of slaughtering the “redskins”
in their camps and country, the enraged
Virginians marched eighty miles through a rough,
trackless wilderness, without bread or tents, and
on the 24th day of October encamped on the
banks of Congo, under the spreading boughs
of the historic tree, and within less than four
miles of the great town of the Shawnees, located
on the west bank of the Scioto river, now known
as “Westfall.” Chief Cornstalk had been scouting
Colonel Lewis’s movements, and he, with the
chiefs of other tribes, were beseeching Lord
Dunmore to stop Colonel Lewis and save their
towns and women and children.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>LORD DUNMORE’S CAMPAIGN.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Thrice had Lewis received orders to halt, but
on he went; and when near the Indian town, he
was intercepted by Dunmore, who drew his sword<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
upon Lewis and threatened him with instant
death if he persisted in any further disobedience,
and marched the army back to Camp Lewis,
where the treaty went on to a satisfactory conclusion,
in the presence of two thousand five
hundred troops and all the confederate chiefs and
their warriors.</p>

<p>There was one chief absent whom Dunmore
much desired present&mdash;Logan, the great warrior
of the Mingoes&mdash;who felt his people had been
very unfortunate in their attempts at peaceful
relations with the whites; and in order to secure
his presence, John Gibson, an interpreter and
friend of Logan’s, was detailed as messenger
with dispatches to the chief, who resided at Old
Chillicothe (Westfall), about four miles distant
from Camp Lewis.</p>

<p>Of this matter Captain Gibson says, under
oath, he found Logan at his home, but refused
to attend the council, and that at the chief’s request
they walked out some distance into the
woods and sat down. Logan appeared much
affected, and after shedding many tears and
showing other manifestations of sorrow, told his
pathetic story in reply to the request from Lord
Dunmore, and which Gibson translated into English
and delivered to Dunmore in the council
assembled under the boughs of this noble tree on
the banks of the Congo&mdash;and was read as follows,
to wit:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I appeal to any white man to say if ever he
entered Logan’s cabin hungry and I gave him
not meat; if ever he came cold or naked and I
gave him not clothing.</p>

<p>“During the course of the last long and bloody
war Logan remained in his tent, an advocate for
peace. Nay, such was my love for the whites
that those of my countrymen pointed at me as
they passed by and said, ‘Logan is the friend of
the white man.’ I had even thought to have
lived among them, but for the injuries of one
man&mdash;Colonel Cresap&mdash;who last spring, in cold
blood and unprovoked, cut off all the relations of
Logan, not sparing even my women and children.
There runs not a drop of my blood in the
veins of any human creature. This called on
me for revenge&mdash;I have sought it. I have killed
many. I have fully glutted my vengeance. For
my country I rejoice at the beams of peace. Yet
do not harbor the thought that mine is the joy
of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not
turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there
to mourn for Logan? Not one.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The authorship of this message has been
doubted and disputed by reason of its greatness.
But it is well known that many of the native
men of America have shown an ability for expression
of thoughts surpassed by no people or
nation in the world. Who could have thought
it&mdash;who could have said it so effectively, by every
gesture and living fiber&mdash;as it was expressed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Tecumseh, after finishing a speech at Vincennes
holding, contrary to the United States Government,
that no one or two tribes could make
treaties conveying away lands without the consent
of others equally interested? When done
speaking, an aide of Governor Harrison, pointing
to a vacant chair, said to Tecumseh, “Your
father requests you to take a seat by his side.”
Drawing his mantle around him, the chief
proudly exclaimed: “My father! The sun (pointing
upward) is my father, and the earth my
mother; on her bosom I will repose,” and seated
himself on the ground where he had been standing.
And it is unusual, at least, that one with
learning and general acquaintance with the high
standard of natural ability of the Indian, and
after so many years, should enter into a voluminous
correspondence to prove that he (Jefferson)
did not write “Logan’s reply.”</p>

<p>Some years since, a partial investigation of the
papers of Lord Dunmore was made. While the
original Gibson translation was not discovered,
there was much to confirm the statements here
given.</p>

<p>The expedition of Dunmore with an army of
three thousand men into the heart of an Indian
country, with mountains and wilderness hundreds
of miles between him and supplies, at
that early date, with that existing animosity between
the Indians and his Virginia soldiery,
makes it appear now, as it did at the time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
many of his soldiers, of singular significance.
When the military expedition reached the point
of destination it found the enemy praying for
peace. And while the chiefs were entertained in
council, and the braves and soldiers were listening
to Virginia oratory, small bands of maddened
and vicious troops stole away and murdered
Indian women and children, fired their
towns, and with stolen horses discharged themselves
from the army and fled the country.</p>

<p>The Indians were helpless, and the treaty fixing
the Ohio river the boundary line went on,
while the soldiers put in the time making speeches
and passing resolutions. The following should
be ever preserved as the thoughts of men in a far
country, by a captain:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>&mdash;Having now concluded the campaign,
by the assistance of Providence, with
honor and advantage to the colony and ourselves,
it only remains that we should give our country
the stronger assurance that we are ready at all
times, to the utmost of our power, to maintain
and defend her just rights and privileges.</p>

<p>“We have lived about three months in the
woods, without any intelligence from Boston, or
from the delegates at Philadelphia. It is possible,
from the groundless reports of designing
men, that our countrymen may be jealous of the
use such a body would make of arms in their
hands at this critical juncture. That we are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
respectable body is certain, when it is considered
that we can live weeks without bread or salt;
that we can sleep in the open air without any
covering but that of the canopy of heaven; and
that we can march and shoot with any in the
known world. Blessed with these talents, let us
solemnly engage to one another, and our country
in particular, that we will use them for no purpose
but for the honor and advantage of America,
and of Virginia in particular. It behooves us,
then, for the satisfaction of our country, that we
should give them our real sentiments by way of
resolves at this very alarming crisis.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Thereupon the committee presented the following
resolutions, which carried, and ordered
printed in the <cite>Virginia Gazette</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That we will bear the most faithful
allegiance to His Majesty, King George the Third,
while His Majesty delights to reign over a brave
and free people; that we will, at the expense of
life and every thing dear and valuable, exert ourselves
in the support of the honor of his crown
and the dignity of the British Empire. But as
the love of liberty and attachment to the real interests
and just rights of America outweigh every
other consideration, we resolve we will exert
every power within us for the defense of American
liberty, and for the support of her just
rights and privileges&mdash;not in any precipitous,
riotous or tumultuous manner, but when regularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
called forth by the unanimous voice of our
countrymen.</p>

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That we entertain the greatest respect
for his excellency, the Rt. Hon. Lord Dunmore,
who commanded the expedition against the
<em>Shawanese</em>, and who we are confident underwent
the great fatigue of this singular campaign from
no other motive than the true interests of the
country.</p>

<p>“Signed by order and in behalf of the whole
corps.</p>

<p class="ir2">“<span class="smcap">Benjamin Ashby</span>, <em>Clerk</em>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>All of which shows political and personal resolutions
have maintained a due degree of hypocrisy
to the present, without material change.</p>

<p>Captain John Boggs and family located on this
place in 1798, before the lands were surveyed or
in market. And from Captain Williamson, an
officer under Lord Dunmore, Captain Boggs procured
many important facts in regard to Camp
Lewis, Logan, and the noted tree. This large
and valuable tract of land, on which the tree
stands passed from the United States into the
hands of Captain John Boggs, and is still owned
by his descendants.</p>

</div>

<p>In memory of the family settlement and historic
events of the spot, John Boggs the third
erected a handsome monument where stood the
cabin in which three generations were born. The
monument is within one hundred and fifty feet
of the Logan Elm, is of pure granite, twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
feet square, base six feet, shaft fifteen feet,
tapering. On each side are cut letters in commemoration
of events connected with that spot.
On one side is firmly set in the granite a bronze
tablet, thirty by fifteen inches, bearing the picture
of the capture of Captain Boggs’ son, William,
in bas-relief. The figures depicted represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
a thrilling and vivid scene which on that
spot actually once occurred in view of the agonized
family.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Indian Raid.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The landscape is an exact representation of the
surroundings. In the left-hand corner is a log
cabin, at the corner of which is the figure of an
Indian with a gun to his shoulder; to the left,
and fronting the cabin door stands an Indian.
At the right of this is a field of wheat surrounded
by a rail-fence. Several panels have been thrown
down in the night, and the cattle are in the field
eating the grain. Near the fence is seen a boy
running up a slight ascent, making his way to a
palisade on the elevation beyond&mdash;after him are
two Indians in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>The Indians, under cover of darkness, had
torn down the fence and turned the cattle upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the growing grain; then secreted themselves for
events that might occur in the morning. The
decoy was successful. The boy, awakening early,
found the destructive scene, and, unsuspecting
the authors of the mischief, proceeded at once to
drive out the herd and to restore the fence. Suddenly
an apparition of a hostile foe rises before
him. He at once retreats toward the cabin, but
there too he sees a redskin awaiting his approach.
He turns, and, with the speed of dying fright,
vainly endeavors to make the palisade on the
elevation; but his course is beset with increasing
pursuers on all sides, and at length, exhausted,
is overcome and made captive to Indian cunning.</p>

<p>All this time, Captain Boggs stood sentinel at
the cabin’s corner, guarding the family, while
the son is relentlessly pursued by the hostile
enemy. The whole is depicted and for the time
preserved in bronze and granite; and as generations
of the future stand before this consecrated
record, it will extort thoughts of the pioneer&mdash;his
pleasures and his sufferings&mdash;with venerated admiration
for those whose lives marked out the
pathway of our civilization.</p>

<p>Every nation, every country, and every town
has historic trees. They are not without influence
on the destiny of individuals, societies, and
nations. They are objects of reverence&mdash;works

wisdom of creation. In the <em>tree</em> is beheld in perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
an enduring living principle, exceeding
all other forms of life&mdash;beginning in the morning
of creation and ending only with the end of time.
When moth and rust have corroded memorial in
bronze, and years of the unseen future have crumbled
the granite to dust, there will still be standing

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">OHIO&mdash;HER COACH, CANAL, AND STEAMBOAT ERA.</span></h2>


<p>At the close of the Revolution, a majority of
the people cheerfully trusted to the wisdom and
integrity of those who led the way to a country
and conditions on which to found a republic.
The patriots who unfurled the Declaration of Independence
were glorified in the name of “United
States of America.” And with thirteen stars,
the red, white, and blue came forth a government
strong and vigorous, honored and respected,
amidst an epidemic of European wars. In the
formation of the republican government, so few
precedents were at hand that could be used as
guides to the organization, the work was rendered
herculean in character. But with General
Washington, John Adams, Jonathan Dayton,
Alexander Hamilton, and other patriotic Federalists,
at the head, the people had no fears for
the accepted Constitution. Still, the first President
and his advisers were not blind to the dangers
that surrounded the new republic. The
First Congress (1789-90) assembled with but a
small and uncertain majority favorable to the
Constitution as adopted; and the combination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
disaffected and opposing elements wore loud in
their denunciations of the President and “<em>that
instrument</em>;” and it required great wisdom, moderation,
and concession to obtain the necessary
contemplated amendments<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and acts of Congress
necessary to carry on and regulate the working
operations of the several departments of the new
government.</p>

<p>The citizens of the South, and those of the
North were equally jealous of their interests.
New England demanded a protective tariff, and
the South “free-trade.” That which suited one
locality was the policy not desired in another.
Consequently, some states felt they were treated
unfairly in <em>this</em>, and others in <em>that</em>, and a Congress
failing to legislate special benefits to all
found denunciations common with a disregard for
law and order, occasionally amounting to open
rebellion.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>At the very commencement of President Washington’s
second term, things became stormy and
taxed the wisdom of the man who had crowned
a successful revolution, to manipulate the new
machinery of a complex government into satisfactory
running order. The cabinet and both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
branches of the legislative department were
pretty evenly divided on the distracting questions
of the times. France and England were at
war&mdash;the French Republic expected reciprocal
help from the United States. The Secretary
of State (Mr. Jefferson) and Mr. Randolph, Attorney-General,
contrary to the views of the
President, espoused the cause of France, and
were suspected of aiding Genet, the French
minister, in issuing commissions to vessels of
war to sail from American ports and cruise
against the enemies of France.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, and the violent opposition
of both houses of Congress, the President
remained firm, that the people of the United
States, under the circumstances, should not become
involved in a war with Great Britain, and
issued his neutrality proclamation, had the French
minister recalled and accepted the resignation of
the Secretary of State. Congress, however, persisted
in doing all it could to strengthen the opposition
to the President and bring on a war with
England. When foiled in this, attempted by
resolution to adopt the substance of Mr. Jefferson’s
final report&mdash;“to cut off all intercourse with
Great Britain, and as good <em>republicans</em> or <em>democrats</em>,
either wear the ‘national cockade’ as evidence
of opposition to <em>neutrality</em> and <em>friendship</em> for
<em>France</em>.”</p>

<p>The resolution passed the House but was defeated
in the Senate, by the casting vote of Vice-President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
John Adams, and saved the nation
from disgrace. The common people had been
partially persuaded by the doctrines of Jefferson
that federalism meant the establishment of a
limited monarchy, and want of confidence in the
people. This was giving the position of Washington
and his followers a coloring much below
their patriotic conceptions. They held a government
of laws must have principle of energy and
coercion; and it was the concentration of this
energy in a federal government which the convention
gave, and which, to carryout into perfection,
induced the Washington policy.</p>

<p>Had it been otherwise, had Mr. Jefferson’s
ideas of government been placed in his own
hands for organization, with his unlimited confidence
in the virtue of the people, and their
capacity for self government in the final experiment,
the Constitution would have crumbled to
pieces in his own hands. At the end of eight
years of Washington’s administration, 1797, the
nation was at peace at home and abroad&mdash;all
disputes had been settled amicably excepting that
of France&mdash;the credit of the government was
never better&mdash;ample provision had been made
for the payment of the public debt&mdash;“commerce
had experienced unexampled prosperity&mdash;American
tonnage had nearly doubled&mdash;the products of
agriculture had found a ready market&mdash;the exports
had increased from nineteen millions to
more than fifty-six million dollars&mdash;and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
amount of revenues from imports exceeded the
most sanguine expectations, and the prosperity
of the country was unparalleled, notwithstanding
great losses from belligerent depredations.” How
different the story when Mr. Jefferson turned the
high office over to Mr. Madison, March 4, 1809,
as given in the report of a committee of the
legislature of Massachusetts, January previous
to the close of Mr. Jefferson’s administration.</p>

<p>“Our agriculture is discouraged, the fisheries
abandoned, navigation forbidden; our commerce
at home and abroad restrained, if not annihilated;
our navy sold, dismantled, or degraded to the
service of cutters or gunboats; the revenue extinguished;
the course of justice interrupted,
and the nation weakened by internal animosities
and divisions, at the moment when it is unnecessarily
and improvidently exposed to war with
Great Britain, France and Spain.”</p>

<p>The most peculiar and damaging political view
held by Mr. Jefferson was that appropriations by
the government for national internal improvements
were unconstitutional. This was enforced
as a cardinal principle of his “<em>Republican-Democratic</em>”
party, and so influenced his party successors,
Madison and Monroe, that during their administrations,
appropriations and surveys were
refused on constitutional grounds. However
good, influential and honest the actors may have
been, it is quite evident the political influences
of those in power, from the commencement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the administration of Thomas Jefferson in 1801
to the end of Monroe’s in 1825, blocked the
wheels of progress in civilization under the pretext
of reverence for the Constitution.</p>

<p>It was generally rumored in Ohio politics that
the Jeffersonian party were opposed to expenditures
for national internal improvements, and
before entering the Union the state presented her
influence with the Eighth Congress for a national
highway, from Cumberland, Maryland, to the
Ohio river at Wheeling, Virginia, and from
Wheeling westward across the proposed State of
Ohio. The measure passed Congress and was
approved by President Jefferson as “a <em>war measure</em>
and bond of union,” instead of an “<em>unconstitutional
improvement</em>.”</p>

<p>This, however, was not considered, by Mr.
Jefferson nor his party, binding in policy as a
precedent; but Ohio politicians thought differently,
and from necessity and importance of the
subject kept it agitated in and out of Congress.
And in 1816, after an able and full discussion of
the constitutionality and expediency of a system
of internal improvements by the general government,
both houses of the Fourteenth Congress
passed a bill appropriating the bonus which the
United States Bank was to pay the Government
for the charter, to purposes of internal improvement;
but the bill was returned to Congress by
the President (Mr. Madison) with his veto involving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
constitutional scruples, and the measure
failed to become a law.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding both houses of Congress were
at times favorable to improvements, the majority
was not often found conservative, and in 1822
killed a small appropriation to repair the Cumberland
road, built and controlled by the Government.</p>

<p>A small majority of the Eighteenth Congress,
in 1823 and 1824, came around partially to the
grounds occupied by the Ohio people on the subject
of improvements, and made an appropriation
of thirty thousand dollars, authorizing the
expenditure on surveys, plans and estimates of
such roads and canals as the President might
deem of national importance.</p>

<p>President Monroe, after mature deliberation,
gave the bill his approval. At that date, a portion
of the New York and Erie Canal was in operation,
and as an orator was very convincing and
converting. This could not justly be called a
“war measure,” nor a “bond of union;” and
was universally accepted as a second precedent
in favor of “internal improvements,” and ended
the Jeffersonial dynasty as far south as the City
of Washington; and in 1829 Andrew Jackson, in
direct opposition to his supporters in the South,
New England, and in New York, followed the
precedent of Ex-President J. Q. Adams, indorsing
the action of the Twentieth Congress, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
declared the <em>constitutionality and expediency</em> of such
improvements.</p>

<p>This fixed the policy of the Government for
all future time, Ohio, feeling proud in the active
part she had taken, having the honor of bringing
about the first national internal improvement
in the United States.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Spinning-Wheel.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Although the Government had changed its
policy, the political education of the people had
been such that many good citizens had little or
no desire for changes or improvements that might
destroy or disregard the sanctity of the constitution;
nor could it be claimed they were much in
favor of improvements of any kind&mdash;things were
good enough. They did not expect to have every
thing in the world, and were satisfied if things
would remain as they were; they did not want
any thing better than the easy routine in which
they had spent much of their lives. The New
York Canal was talked of as a private enterprise;
but for what purpose above the cost of
labor could not be stated, as there were no <em>surplus
productions</em> in the country calling for a market,
and so far Ohio people were “high <em>protectionists</em>
of <em>home industries</em>,” and did not favor the introduction
of “<em>cheap foreign goods, nor imported
labor</em>.” They raised flax and wool, and, with the
spinning-wheel and loom, manufactured the wearing
apparel and household goods, and so sure as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Man wants but little here below,
</div><div class="indent0">Nor wants that little long,”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>the average citizen felt amply supplied with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
necessaries of life, and could not well ask for
more. He plowed his little piece of cleared
ground with a “bull-plow,” having a wooden
mold-board and cast-iron share; harrowed in his
wheat, rye, oats, and turnips with a wooden-toothed
harrow; dropped his corn by hand, and
covered it with the hoe. Every spring he made
enough maple-sugar for home consumption, and
to exchange for tea, coffee, and salt; and if he had
a few spare bushels of grain, they were taken to
some one of the many copper-stills scattered over
the country. And to him there was no encouragement
for the improvement in wealth of state
by establishing a commerce or trade that would
sap the foundations of its home industries. And
he feared for the future prospects of the North-west
should the existing prohibitory tariff be removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
between the East and West by cheap
transportation, believing it would destroy home
manufactures, diminish the price of labor, and
produce “<em>panics</em> and <em>paupers</em>” beyond state ability
and charity to maintain. The “flax-breaker’s”
occupation would be gone; carding-machines,
spinning-wheels, and looms, would no
longer be manufactured or used, and the vast
multitude of laborers carrying on these “infant
industries” would be thrown out of employment
and be “obliged to <em>steal</em> or <em>starve</em>.” Even the
young woman, who makes an honest living by
spinning sixteen “cuts” daily, at fifty cents a
week and boarded, would be thrown upon the
cold embraces of the world, and thousands
of other honest poor would be ruined for
want of <em>protection</em> against such an influx of
“pauper labor and foreign manufacture.” And
the man of <em>one idea</em> considered the condition of
“home industries,” under contemplated internal
improvements, as discouraging, as a “prospective
repeal of a protective tariff.”</p>

<p>As early as 1807, Jesse Hawley conceived the
idea of a canal from the Hudson river to Lake
Erie&mdash;a distance of three hundred and fifty
miles&mdash;believing it would be a profitable investment
for the state and nation, that it would populate
the North-west and establish important commercial
relations with western states. But the
newspapers pronounced Jesse “<em>a crank</em>,” and refused
to make public his thoughts upon the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
But this did not change the opinions of
practical business men, whose talk of canals and
intersecting canals did not meet with much favor
among legislators, which, perhaps, represented
the sentiments of their constituents. And it took
nearly half as long as it did the people of New
York to build the Erie canal, for those of Ohio
to understand that a canal, commerce and free
trade, would increase labor and enrich a state.
And for the timely commencement of the great
work the people of Ohio are much indebted to
W. Steele, of Cincinnati, for his trial surveys
and intelligent letters upon the subject at an
early day, when few persons entertained the
practicability of such an undertaking.</p>

<p>The following extracts from a letter published
in the Olive Branch, February 27, 1821, on the
“Project of a Canal,” is but a fair specimen of
the philanthropy of the times, and says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Nothing
can be of more importance to the State of
Ohio than the making of a navigable canal from
Lake Erie to the Ohio river. That it is practicable
to make such canal admits not of a doubt.
Were it made, and the Hudson and Erie canal
finished, we should have an easy and cheap highway
on which to transport our surplus produce
to the New York market. I have had the level
between the Scioto and the Sandusky bay at
Lower Sandusky. From the summit level on the
most favorable route for a canal that I am acquainted
with, to Lower Sandusky, the descent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
agreeable to the report of Mr. Farrer, whom I
employed for the purpose of taking the levels, is
318 feet.... And by the report of the engineers
employed by the State of Virginia, they
make the Ohio river at the mouth of the Great
Kanawha river 83 feet lower than Lake Erie. If
those levels are to be relied on, and we ascertain
what is the amount of descent in the Ohio river
from the mouth of the Great Kanawha to the
point where the canal is intended to communicate
with the Ohio, we will then know what will be
the whole amount of lockage required. If we
allow 50 feet for the descent, the lockage will be
as follows: From Lake Erie to the summit level,
318 feet; and from summit level to Ohio river,
433 feet; making the whole amount, 751 feet. I
do not know how near this estimate is to the
truth, but I am satisfied in my own mind the
lockage would be between seven and eight hundred
feet.</p>

<p>“The estimate of the commissioners for making
the New York canal is $13,800 per mile. Owing
to the reduction in the price of labor it is found
it can be made for much less money. The ground
for making a canal across the State of Ohio is
much more favorable than that over which the
New York canal is now making. Although there
would be more lockage on the Ohio canal than
on the New York, yet it is believed it can be
made at less expense than an equal distance of
the New York canal. When we take into consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the low price at which labor can be
had, and the advantage to be gained by the employment
of experienced engineers now employed
on the New York canal, I think I hazard but
little in saying that a canal can be made across
this state for $12,000 a mile.”... “I am
aware that some will say that ‘the State of Ohio
is too young and too poor to undertake this
mighty project.’ But I deny that the State of
Ohio is either young or poor. She contains at
this time more than 500,000 souls, and ranks
fourth or fifth state in the Union. Can a state
with such a population (of industrious people,
too) be poor? It has been justly remarked,
‘<em>That population is power</em>; and <em>industry is wealth</em>,’
so I contend that we are both <em>powerful</em> and <em>rich</em>.</p>

<p>“The inquiry of some will be, how is the
money to be raised to dig this ‘mighty ditch?’
Raise it in the same way New York does&mdash;borrow
it on the credit of the state. Many there
are, I have no doubt, who will <em>doubt</em> whether
money can be borrowed on the credit of the state.
To such I would say, go and try. If we stand
at the base of a hill and look up, without making
an effort to ascend, we will never reach its
summit....</p>

<p>“Although it cost $2,400,000 (to make 200
miles), it might not be necessary to borrow any
thing like that sum. The distribution of the
sum required would go to the people of the state,
and give more relief from their present pecuniary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
embarrassments than can be had from any laws
enacted for that purpose. As the lands in the
vicinity of the canal belonging to the general
government would be greatly enhanced in value,
I think it not improbable that Congress will
make a donation to the state of a body of land
in the vicinity, so far as it passes through their
territory; if so, it would aid very much in making
it.</p>

<p>“A member of the House of Commons once
asked an eminent engineer for what purpose he
apprehended ‘rivers were made.’ His answer
was ‘to feed navigable canals.’ Such was the
opinion of a great man, and such indeed must
have been the opinion of many others, for we
find canals in Great Britain in many places running
parallel with navigable rivers. Persons unacquainted
with the cheapness at which goods
are transported on canals, are surprised when
they learn that a ton weight can be transported
at the rate of one cent a mile. The illustrious
Fulton, but a short time previous to his death,
gave it as his opinion that goods could be transported
on the New York canal, when completed,
at the rate of one cent a ton per mile. We find
him supported in this by Col. C. G. Haines, corresponding
secretary to the New York association
for the promotion of internal improvement.</p>

<p>“Mr. Phillips, in the preface of his history of
‘Inland Navigation,’ says: ‘All canals may be
considered as so many roads of a certain kind on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
which one horse will draw as much as thirty
horses do on ordinary turnpike roads,
and the public would be great gainers were they
to lay out upon making every mile of canal
twenty times as much as they expend upon
making a mile of turnpike road.’ And Sutcliff, in
his treatise on canals, says: ‘That within the
last twenty-five years there has been expended on
canals in England more than one hundred and
thirty million dollars.’ A country is never
made poor by making internal improvements,
even if the people are taxed to make them. If
money be taken from the people, it is again paid
out among them, and kept in circulation.</p>

<p>“When the canals through Ohio and New York
are finished, I have no doubt but that two-thirds
of the surplus produce of all the country
watered by the Ohio and its tributary streams
above the falls, would pass through them to the
New York market. That it would be to the interest
of every shipper to give the preference to New
York is obvious.... The amount of produce
that perishes on the way and at New Orleans
every fifteen years, would itself more than pay
for building a canal across the State of Ohio.
During the spring tides, when the principal part
of the produce of the western country is carried
to New Orleans, that market is glutted, and the
shipper is very often pleased at being able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
return home with half the money his cargo cost
him.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Fulton’s estimates as to the expenses at
which goods can be transported on canals be correct,
the expenses of transporting a barrel of
flour to the City of New York (allowing ten
barrels for a ton), will be as follows:</p></blockquote>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Transport expenses.">
<tr><td class="tabtitle"><span style="padding-right:1em">From Ohio river to Lake Erie, 200 m.</span></td><td class="tabtitleright">20c</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tabtitle">Down the lake, 260 m.</td><td class="tabtitleright">20c</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tabtitle">New York canal, 353 m.</td><td class="tabtitleright">35c</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tabtitle">Down the Hudson, 160 m.</td><td class="tabtitleright">15c</td></tr>
</table></div>

<blockquote>

<p>“Total nine hundred and seventy-three miles for
ninety cents. To this must be added the tollage
of both canals. The lowest rate at which flour
at present is freighted to New Orleans from the
falls is $1.25 per barrel. Nor is it probable that
the price will be reduced, as the boat which cost
$100 to $150 is generally thrown away at New
Orleans, or sold for a sum not exceeding the
tenth part of their cost.</p>

<p>“It will be recollected, that while our produce
is carried to New York at the cheap rate quoted
above, that our foreign goods can be brought
through the same channel at the same rates, from
sixty-seven cents to one dollar and twelve cents
per ton. More or less of these goods the people
will have, and the cheaper the rates at which
they can be furnished, the better for the country.
And besides, it must be recollected if they are
brought across the mountains, by way of Pittsburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
or from New Orleans by way of the Mississippi
and Ohio, that the expense of transportation
is paid to citizens of other states; if brought
over the Ohio canal, the money saved in the state
thereby, would, in twenty five years, amount to
more than the whole cost of the canal.</p>

<p>“It must be admitted that the risk on the canal
and lake is much less than on the Ohio and Mississippi,
and the time required to carry the produce
that way much less. By turning the trade
from New Orleans to New York, we would save
thereby the lives of many of our most enterprising
and useful citizens, who would otherwise fall
victims to the diseases of the lower Mississippi.
The State of Kentucky has lost more of her citizens
by the New Orleans trade within the last fifteen
years than she lost by the late war, and it is
known she bled at every pore.</p>

<p>“Lateral canals may be made from the main
canals in many places, which will serve to collect
to the main canal the rich products of the soil
through which they pass, and at the same time
afford means of furnishing the country with many
of the necessities of life at prices greatly below
what they now cost without the canal. I will
only name the article of salt, which by means of
the canal may be furnished to people in the interior
of the state from the salines of New York at
a price but little, if any thing, exceeding fifty
cents per bushel. It is impossible to calculate
the benefits that may be derived to the people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
this state by the making of the canal. In its
progress it will, no doubt, lay open rich beds of
minerals. It will lay us, as it were, alongside
the Atlantic. It will, in short, <em>elevate the character
of the state, and put it half a century in advance
of her present situation</em>....</p>

<p>“It only remains for the legislature of Ohio to
apply the means within their reach to accomplish
this desirable object. When accomplished, there
can be no doubt but that it will produce a sufficient
revenue to defray the expense’s of the state
government.</p>

<p>The arguments made for internal improvements
were good; but to the child of nature such
talk became a source of alarm. To destroy the
forests would diminish the game supply, and he
soon began to feel the country was becoming too
highly civilized for good and easy living; that
buckskin breeches and tow trowsers were already
being discarded for imported goods. And when
the spirit of advancing civilization came within
sight, he who had no fence around his cabin, or
little else besides sunflowers or a peach tree to
indicate manual labor near the unbounded premises,
sold his land at a small advance, and, with
family and dogs, moved out to “Ingianny.”</p>

<p>Previous to 1820 the inhabitants of the North-west
had very little prospect that agriculture
would ever be the “road to affluence.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
natural barriers to transportation were viewed as
permanent obstacles. A water-way was ridiculed
by high authority, which pronounced it
little short of madness, and the newspapers in
the East had shown the impracticability; and
the Western land-owner manifested but little dissatisfaction.
He found his way to this country
in order to live, and was happy in finding enough
to make it easy. He anticipated but little from
agriculture as a source of profit. In the Eastern
states it had not given satisfaction. But with the
population increasing and foreign demand improving,
and facilities for transportation better,
things showed they were undergoing a change in
the older states; and the markets were becoming
better, with better management of farms and
farming, than at any period since colonial times.</p>

<p>In 1823 Charles A. Goodrich, of Hartford,
Conn., wrote: “Until within a few years agriculture,
both as a science and art, is receiving
much of that attention which its acknowledged
importance demands. It is beginning to be regarded,
as it should be, not only as the basis of
subsistence and population, but as the parent of
individual and national opulence.”</p>

<p>At this date corn was selling to feeders at six
cents per bushel in Ohio, and wheat at twenty-five
cents. But a few years later agriculture in
the North-west was beginning to be regarded as
the “basis of subsistence and parent of individual
and national opulence,” also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>The idea of a prospective market for the products
of the soil, that would well remunerate
the labor of production, was already being felt,
and creating an enthusiasm and preparation for
farming on a larger scale. Labor was plenty and
wages fair, and the work of destruction of timber
and increasing the acreage for cultivation
went on rapidly. Large areas were deadened
to facilitate the removal, and the sunshine in
many places found its way to earth, where it had
been excluded for ages. And the common squirrel
hunter soon underwent an expansion of character
that led on to eminence in agriculture, art,
science, commerce, courts, congress, and cabinet.
The things said and done caused the legislature,
in 1822, to pass an act authorizing the employment
of engineers to examine and report the “practicability
of making a canal from Lake Erie to the Ohio
river;” and in 1825, after four years of the most
arduous labor and discussion, the work was determined
upon, and Governor De Witt Clinton
and others, among whom were Solomon Van
Rensselaer, of Albany, and United States Judge
Conkling and Mr. Lord, of New York, were invited
to be present at the commencement of the
great work, which was to have its beginning
three miles west of Newark, July 4, 1825.</p>

<p>The people of the entire state were under
high excitement at the new era which seemed approaching
so rapidly, and acted quite differently
from what they likely would at the present day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
on the commencement of a public enterprise.
Then many thousands assembled to see “The
Father of Internal Improvements,” and to hear
what “the best-looking man the nation had ever
produced” had to say on the subject of which
he was the reputed father.</p>

<p>The time was near at hand, and on the arrival of
the great Governor of New York at Cleveland, the
ovation was grand; he was welcomed by Governor
Morrow, state legislature, officials, military organizations,
and by the people. And flags, and
guns, and noisy display were beyond the power
of description. And before the sun had risen,
July 4, 1825, every thoroughfare to Newark was
crowded with all kinds of loaded vehicles; men
and women on horseback, and men, women, and
children on foot&mdash;many of whom had traveled
all night in order to reach the appointment on
time. And the wonder was, where all the immense,
uncounted, and unaccountable mass of
human-beings came from.</p>

<p>The day was fair and the air cool and balmy,
as Ohio atmosphere is after recent July showers.
Newark at this time had less than one thousand
inhabitants, but the country surrounding was
amply large to accommodate the crowd which
desired to pay their respects to the man whose
influence, energy, ability, and perseverance were
able to advance civilization, at once, half a century,
by the magic wand of public improvements.
And when Governor Clinton’s carriage appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
on the public square at Newark, thousands of
voices rent the air with loud and long huzzas of
welcome; and to which was added, the firing of
one hundred guns. And the immense procession
at once began moving for the spot prepared for the
ceremony of the “<em>spade</em> and <em>barrow</em>,” three miles
in the country. Governor Clinton took the first
spadeful amid the enthusiastic shouts of thousands.
The Ohio Governor, squirrel hunter,
statesman, and farmer, next sunk the implement
its full depth. And so from one to another the
spade passed, until the wheel-barrow could hold
no more, and was taken to the designated dump
by Captain Ned King, of Chillicothe, amid one
wild, indescribable, and continuous cheering.</p>

<p>Hon. Thomas Ewing was orator of the day,
and when the Governor of New York attempted
his reply, the bursts of applause were so great
he was obliged to pause, “and being unaccustomed
to such demonstrations and tokens of respect, shed
tears in the presence of his worshipers.” After
the addresses the entire audience, estimated at
not less than ten thousand, dined in the shade of
the wide-spreading beech trees, the underbrush
having been cleared off from several acres for
the purpose, and seats arranged and tables spread
with a sumptuous dinner for all, furnished by the
liberality of one man, Goetleib Steinman, of
Lancaster, Ohio.</p>

<p>The regular toasts were limited to thirteen,
but the volunteers were still going on when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>

</div>

<p>The 4th of July, 1825, only a few months
prior to the completion of the New York Canal,
machinery was put in motion to revolve until the
end of time. On this day the policy of the state
government in favor of internal improvements
was permanently inaugurated. Even the few
opposing minds of those who had never seen the
walls of China, but wished to maintain the state
secluded from the commercial world by means of
the high tariff (the barriers nature had vouchsafed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to the inhabitants), weakened in their ideas
of “home protection,” or at once became favorable
to the doctrine of <em>reciprocity</em>, which at that
early date was the “soft” or synonym for <em>free
trade</em>. And when it became satisfactorily demonstrated
that improvements would increase the
amount and price of labor, as well as the values
of its products, such individuals changed to vociferous
advocates of a canal, saying: “If the
canal can secure such prices for the products of
the soil, and in return furnish foreign cheap supplies,
we can afford to abandon looms and spinning-wheels,
and let supply and demand take
care of themselves.” And the energetic boards
of construction were unanimously supported by
the people, and soon completed eight hundred
miles of canals and one thousand miles of toll-roads,
with a disbursement of over fifteen million
dollars, borrowed money. The state, however,
suffered no inconvenience on this account; its
credit was good, and all that was necessary to
obtain funds as fast as needed was to call upon
the Lord who came to Ohio with Governor Clinton
at the opening.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the multitude of great men assembled
on this occasion, no one did more or was nearer
and dearer in the hearts of the people than the
man who mastered mathematics, Greek, Latin,
and law, while a “hireling” at the Kanawha Salt
Works; the man who did his reading at night by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the light of the furnace or a “log-cabin luminary,”
a lard lamp; the man who received the
first collegiate degree of
A.M. ever issued in the
North-west; the orator
of the day, Hon. Thomas
Ewing. No such universal
and intense enthusiasm
was ever before, or
again will be, so overwhelmingly
manifested
in Ohio as that of the
opening of the canals; no other object for public
demonstration is likely will ever approach it in
importance.</p>

<p>Governor Clinton and party were escorted from
Newark to Columbus by the state militia, legislature,
county and state officers and eminent
citizens. And in reply to Governor Morrow’s reception,
Governor Clinton said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I find myself at a loss for language to express
my profound sense of the distinguished notice
taken of me by the excellent chief magistrate of
this powerful and flourishing state, and by our
numerous and respected fellow citizens assembled
in this place, I feel that my services have been
greatly overrated, but I can assure you that
your kindness has not fallen on an ungrateful
heart&mdash;that I most cordially and sincerely reciprocate
your friendly sentiments, and that any
agency I may have had in promoting the cardinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
interests to which you have been pleased to refer,
has been as sincere as it has been disinterested.</p>

<p>“When Ohio was an applicant for admission
into the Union, it was my good fortune to have it
in my power, in co-operation with several distinguished
friends, most of whom are now no more, to
promote her views and to assist in elevating her
from a territorial position to the rank of an independent
state. This was an act of justice to
her and duty of high obligation on our part. At
that early period I predicted, and indeed it required
no extraordinary sagacity to foresee, that
Ohio would in due time be a star of the first
magnitude in the federal constellation; that
she contains within her bosom the elements of
greatness and prosperity, and that her population
would be the second, if not the first, in the confederacy.</p>

<p>“The number of your inhabitants at the next
census will probably exceed a million. Cultivation
of the soil has advanced with gigantic strides&mdash;your
fruitful country is teeming with plenty,
and has a vast surplus beyond your consumption
of all the productions of agriculture. Villages,
towns and settlements are springing up and extending
in all directions, and the very ground on
which we stand, but a few years ago a dreary wilderness,
is now a political metropolis of the state,
and the residence of knowledge, elegance and
hospitality.</p>

<p>“I have considered it my solemn duty in concurrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
with your worthy chief magistrate, your very
able canal board of finance and superintendence,
and other patriotic and enlightened citizens of
this state, to furnish all the resources in my
power in aid of the great system of internal
navigation so auspiciously commenced on the
fifteenth anniversary of our national independence.</p>

<p>“This is a cause in which every citizen and
every state in our country is deeply interested;
for the work will be a great centripetal power
that will keep the states within their federal
orbits&mdash;and an adamantine chain that will bind
the Union together in the most intimate connection
of interests and communication. It therefore
secures, not only the prosperity of Ohio,
but the union of the states and the consequent
blessings of free government; and now I think
it my duty to declare that I have the utmost confidence
in the practicability of the undertaking,
and the economy and ability with which it will
be executed. In five years it may, and will be
completed, in all probability, and I am clearly of
the opinion, that in two years after the construction
of this work, it will produce an annual
revenue of at least a million dollars, and hope
this remark may now be noted, if any thing I say
shall be deemed worthy of particular notice, in order
that its accuracy may be tested by experience.</p>

<p>“I beg you, sir, to accept the assurance of my
high respect for your private and public services,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and to feel persuaded that I consider your approbation
and the approbation of patriotic men an
ample reward for my service, that a benevolent
Providence may have enabled me to render to our
common country.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From Columbus the party was escorted to
Springfield, Dayton, Hamilton, and Cincinnati,
receiving public dinners and the most extravagant
and enthusiastic demonstrations of appreciation
and respect by thousands of citizens. At Cincinnati
the party were invited guests to an entertainment
given in honor of Henry Clay.</p>

<p>While Governor Clinton was in Cincinnati,
he yielded to the pressing invitation to go to
Louisville and render an opinion on the question
then in dispute between Kentucky and Indiana,
as to which side of the river was the better
adapted for a canal around the falls. His decided
opinion was in favor of Kentucky, to which
all parties assented, and the canal was constructed
accordingly.</p>

<p>On returning home, the Governor passed
through Portsmouth, Piketon, Chillicothe, Circleville,
Lancaster, Summit, and Zanesville, via
Pittsburgh, receiving every-where the most distinguished
attention.</p>

<p>All business for the time was suspended. He
and his party were every-where treated as Ohio’s
invited guests; and the Governor was attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
by all the county officers, eminent citizens, and
multitudes to the next county line, where a like
escort was in waiting with the best livery the
country could produce; halting at each county
town, for a grand reception, ornamented with
speeches, toasts, flags, and firearms.</p>

<p>Thus the benefactor of the nation passed from
one county to another, across a great state, and
as soon as the advance-guard came in sight of
any town, the bells of all the churches, public
buildings, and hotels, gave their long and merry
peels of welcome&mdash;the cannon roared and a vast
crowd of waiting citizens of town and country
marched forward with huzzas and banners of
“Welcome&mdash;welcome&mdash;to the Father of Internal
Improvements.”</p>

<p>The following extract, written at the time by
a cool-headed representative of the state, is expressive
without coloring or exaggeration:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The grave and the gay, the man of gray
hairs and the ruddy-faced youth; matrons and
maidens, and even lisping children, joined to tell
his worth, and on his virtues dwell; to hail his
approach and welcome his arrival. Every street,
where he passed, was thronged with multitudes,
and the windows were filled with the beautiful
ladies of Ohio, waving their snowy white handkerchiefs,
and casting flowers on the pavement
where he was to pass on it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>No king, emperor, president, or statesman; no
manufacturer of personal or political enthusiasm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
even of palace-car order, ever obtained that intensity
and spontaneous manifestation as was
shown “The Father of Internal Improvements,”
on his passage through the state.</p>

<p>And it is yet a sorrowful reflection to memory,
that such magnetism, ability, and influence for
good did not live to see the Lake Erie and Ohio
Canal completed; that his life’s sacrifices, in
physical and mental efforts for the advancement
of civilization in the North-west, have been so
soon almost forgotten. But more; that his good
works should have been so cheaply recognized at
his death by a state he had enriched by making
himself so poor. But it is never too late to be
just, nor too long to right a wrong.</p>

<p>About this time, an era of “<em>prosperity</em>” had already
dawned in the East, and was heralded from
mouth to mouth&mdash;from the Ohio river to Lake
Michigan&mdash;that the “Erie Canal” was completed,
and the first fleet of boats left the Hudson, October
26, 1825, laden with emigrants for the North-west.</p>

<p>On the banners this fleet carried were the significant
words, “The Star of Empire Westward
Takes its Way,” and the cannons were heard
and answered from Buffalo to New York City.</p>

<p>This canal proved a success even beyond the
expectations of the most sanguine; and a line of
commerce was at once established from tide-water
to the western chain of lakes, and soon filled the
new states with population and their ports with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
merchandise. And the Ohio protectionist, who
had been so fearful of an influx of “pauper labor”
and the products of “<em>foreign industries</em>,”
found his own state, while discussing it, ready
to disburse fifteen million dollars for day labor in
the construction of internal improvements. And
the Squirrel Hunter, whose life was one of education,
development, power, and progress, hailed
with delight the opportunity to work on the Lake
Erie canal, twenty-six dry days of twelve hours
each, for the sum of eight dollars. It was the
first privilege ever offered in Ohio to obtain so
much money in so short time, without encroachment
upon his store of squirrel and coon skins.</p>

<p>In 1824, the year before the completion of the
Erie canal, prices of produce still ranged low:
twenty-five cents for wheat and six cents for
corn, with no market or demand excepting for
making whisky with copper stills. But when
the Erie canal was finished and the Ohio and
Lake Erie under way, prices on all kinds of
produce advanced more than two hundred per
cent, with such an unlimited demand that the
improvements converted every body into favor
with public works. And times became better in
Ohio than ever before&mdash;corn advanced to forty
and fifty cents and wheat to seventy-five and
one dollar per bushel; and with the state distribution
of millions of money, and her rich and
productive soil, she was lifted out of the groove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
of idle content into the bright sunshine of prosperity
and improvement.</p>

<p>It soon became manifest that internal improvements
increased the demand and prices of the
products of the soil, with a diminution in value
of most all kinds of manufactured articles used in
exchange. The salines of New York killed the
salt manufacture in Ohio as effectually as free
trade did the business of the wheelwright, the
reelwright, the manufacturer of looms, reeds,
flyers, hackles, plows, nails, and other “infant
industries.” All were ended by the canal; and
a man or boy who desired a new hat had, no
longer than 1825, to go to a “<em>hat shop</em>” and have
his head measured with a tape-line, and diagram
registered, with full directions of minor matters&mdash;material,
color, and price&mdash;and then wait the
making.</p>

<p>By means of the New York canal, peddlers
were offering for sale almost every thing enjoyed
in the East, “at unprecedented low prices;” and
even the meridian mark in the south doorway
was of no use any longer, except to regulate a
Yankee clock. These Connecticut time-pieces
were distributed to nearly every resident landholder
in the state at sixty dollars or less, on a
year’s credit, in the form of a note with six per
cent interest&mdash;a clock that cost the peddler two
dollars and fifty cents at a New England factory.</p>

<p>Traveling merchants of all kinds flocked into
the North-west like squirrels at moving time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and the epidemic struck Pennsylvania so disastrously
that the Hon. John Andrew Schultz, at
the time governor of that state, is reported as
having memorialized the legislature for a law
preventing this class of non-residents from perambulating
the country, selling articles of no
value, and often base counterfeits of things of
domestic use, saying that in his neighborhood,
“They were palming off counterfeit basswood
nutmegs, when every body knows the genuine
are made of sassafrac.”</p>

<p>The opening of the canal trade gave interest
and amusement to thousands of persons. On the
day appointed citizens came long distances to
witness the filling of the ditch with water, and
the floating of boats as they came along in the
pride of the names they bore in honor of favorite
citizens living along the line, as “The James
Rowe,” “The Dr. Coats,” “The James Emmitt,”
“The Sam Campbell,” “The General Worthington,”
etc., lettered in gold, all of which was
purely complimentary to the individual, and not
thought of as an advertising dodge, although it
may have suggested afterwards its advantages in
this line to members of the Board of Public
Works.</p>

<p>The remarkable advancement in the prosperity
of the state resulting from the canals exceeded
the expectations of their best friends so far that
it will probably ever remain as the most notable
era in the history of the state. Increased prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and rising civilization advanced step by
step. From the pack-saddle to the freight-wagon,
stage-coach, canal-boat, steamboat and railroad,
each served or is serving a good purpose in the
elevation of the social, intellectual and moral
faculties of American citizens.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Ohio Stage Coach.</p></div>
</div>

<p>From the organization of the state until the introduction
of canals and railroads, inland transportation
of merchandise and travel was done by
means of stage-coaches and freight-wagons. The
coaches were stoutly constructed, with leather
suspensions for springs, with inside dimensions
for nine persons, and somewhat like a Chicago
street-car&mdash;enough room outside for all who were
able to find a place to “hang on.” At the rear
each coach was provided with a capacious boot
for the accommodation of Saratoga trunks and
U. S. mail-bags. The driver had an elevated
outside seat in front, and proudly pulled the
strings on four spirited horses, which were driven
in relays of ten miles, and under favorable circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
would, in this way, make eight miles
an hour, including stops for changes, and times
of arrival and departure at the stations were
very punctually made on good roads.</p>

<p>Often it became amusing to see how easy a
good-hearted driver who loved his team, as many
drivers did, could favor it by letting the horses
walk up each little ascent, but when in sight of
the change would blow the horn and crack the
whip, and go in flying, with a mark “behind
time” for the next driver and relay to make up.
But the “make up” seldom came, and it was
nothing unusual in a distance of two hundred
miles to find the coaches fifteen to twenty hours
behind the schedule time.</p>

<p>There were no improved roads north of Columbus
for nearly fifty years, and during the wet
season, or thawing of the frozen road-bed, staging
became slow and laborious. If not mixed
with pleasure, it was the only means of inland
intercourse of a public character the inhabitants
could look to.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens, on his way from Columbus,
Ohio, to Buffalo, N. Y., <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</i> Sandusky City, in
1842, accurately describes the roughness of traveling
by stage-coach and the jolting of the corduroy
roads over bogs and swamps, and says: “At
length, between ten and eleven o’clock at night,
a few feeble lights appeared in the distance, and
Upper Sandusky, an Indian village, where we
were to stay till morning, lay before us. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
were gone to bed at the log inn, which was
the only house of entertainment in the place, but
soon answered our knocking, and got some tea
for us in a sort of kitchen or common room,
tapestried with old newspapers pasted against
the wall.</p>

<p>“The bed-chamber to which my wife and I were
shown was a large, low, ghostly room, with a
quantity of withered branches on the hearth,
and two doors without any fastening, opposite
to each other, both opening upon the black night
and wild country, and so contrived that one of
them always blew the other open, a novelty in
domestic architecture which I do not remember
to have seen before, and which I was somewhat
disconcerted to have forced on my attention after
getting into bed, as I had a considerable sum in
gold for our traveling expenses in my dressing
case. Some of the luggage, however, piled
against the panels, soon settled this difficulty,
and my sleep would not have been very much
affected that night, I believe, though it had
failed to do so.</p>

<p>“My Boston friend climbed up to bed somewhere
in the roof, where another guest was already
snoring hugely. But being bitten beyond his
power of endurance, he turned out again, and
fled for shelter to the coach, which was airing
itself in front of the house. This was not a very
politic step as it turned out, for the pigs scenting
him, and looking upon the coach as a kind of pie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
with some manner of meat inside, grunted around it
so hideously that he was afraid to come out again,
and lay there shivering till morning. Nor was it
possible to warm him, when he did come out,
by means of a glass of brandy, for in Indian
villages the legislature, with a very good and
wise intention, forbids the sale of spirits by
tavern-keepers.”</p>

<p>For want of roads, traveling by coach was
slow and laborious, in all the north-western
states. In 1840, the writer was treated to a five
cents per mile ride across the State of Michigan,
from Detroit to New Buffalo, now Benton Harbor,
on Lake Michigan, a distance of two hundred
miles. It was mid-winter, but not frozen
hard, and required nearly three days and two
nights of joltings and fatiguing monotony. The
joys felt on arriving in sight of steamboat navigation
are still fresh in the recollections of the
past.</p>

<p>Stage coaches had their centers for distribution
in Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati, and were
used in the principal mail lines over the state.
Here too, the African skin became a perplexing
question. The dictum of slavery had to be respected.
If a colored person desired to be carried
to a given point, he could prepay to such&mdash;his
money was never refused on any account
but for his color there was no time-table of departure
or arrival. If no objections were raised
by a passenger, he would at once be started on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
his way as an outside incumbrance. But if at any
time while on the route, at a station or “change,”
a passenger should be added who objected to
riding in the same coach with a “<em>free nigger</em>,”
as was no unusual thing, the colored passenger
would be obliged to stop off and wait for a coach
containing more liberal sentiments, or take the
road on foot. This treatment on all the coach
lines was witnessed so frequently that it ceased
to call forth marks of disapproval. The principle
in a milder form appears to have been
transferred from the old stage-coach to the great
railroad Cincinnati built South, by ignoring the
constitution of the state, and as some thought at
the time, subsidizing the Supreme Court. On
this road the American born citizen with African
blood, however remote the descent, or great the
admixture, is refused admittance to coaches accorded
to all other nationalities. Why? it is
not necessary to state.</p>

<p>The wagons for freight were large and strong,
and, having a cover of white canvas, gave them
the name of “Prairie Schooners.” They were
usually drawn by six horses, and on long routes
traveled in companies; and trains could be seen
moving slowly along in line, all laden with merchandise
of the East, or on their way East, carrying
the products of Ohio industry to an eastern
market. The style of the “schooner” and
the wagons themselves have “been out of print”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
so long, not one appeared on exhibition at the
Centennial World’s Fair. They were all of the
same pattern, and as “near alike as peas;” differing
in every respect from the emigrant wagon
of later date.</p>

<div id="Ref_306" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_306.jpg" width="600" height="216" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Prairie Schooner.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The bed or body of the “schooner” was formed
by a stout frame-work of the best seasoned
bent-wood, and put together as immovable and
durable as any railroad coach body of the present
day. The shape, covering, etc., is shown by
<a href="#Ref_306">annexed illustration</a>. The teams were composed
of large draft-horses. The “near” wheel-horse
carried a saddle, in addition to his harness, for
the accommodation of the driver. This saddle-horse,
with the near front animal, or “leader,”
constituted the managing horses of the whole
team. All orders were given, as required, to
these; they were always wakeful, watchful, and
obedient. A good leader and a reliable near
wheel-horse were boastful prizes of their owners;
and most teamsters in those days owned their entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
outfits, and were exceedingly kind to their
animals.</p>

<p>What may seem peculiar, whether having four
or six animals in the team, the driver used only
a single line&mdash;one string attached to the “leader,”
and to him, with the aid of the “saddle-horse,”
safety and correct actions of all the members of
the team were assured.</p>

<p>Many were the thousands of tons these lines
carried over the mountains. But the tread of the
caravan and the crack of the “black-snake”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
were no longer heard on the Alleghanies after
the completion of the Erie Canal (in 1825); and
ceased entirely as a system of transportation on
the operation of the Ohio Canal (in 1832). The
“schooners” and “Branches of the United
States Bank” wound up and quit business in
Ohio about the same time. It was an off year
for political speculators. President Jackson
vetoed the bill to renew the charter of that monster
monopoly entitled “The United States
Bank,” an institution owned and controlled by
a few wealthy foreign and American citizens,
who were receiving exclusive privileges, favors,
and support from the government.</p>

<p>Ohio did not feel the suspension of this great
monopoly with its thirty-five millions so severely.
Millions of money had just been distributed over
the state for labor in the construction of internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
improvements, and with canals, coaches, and
steamboats, and agriculture in a nourishing condition,
the prosperity that seemed lost in the
ruins of speculation and bankruptcy, proved a
small impediment in line of progress or march
of empire.</p>

<p>The people did not become idle or discouraged;
farming interests were increasing all the time,
and more attention was directed to schools and
education than ever before; and civilization was
manifestly and permanently on the advance.
Still the conditions of trade suffered serious embarrassments
connected with the unstable condition
of the currency or money of the country.
Bank-notes of one state were at a heavy discount
in every other. This, with bank and individual
failures, caused much inconvenience for a time,
but things soon grew better. Population and
aggregate wealth of the state increased, and in 1847
gave the greatest yield of produce ever previously
harvested, and which, owing to the “Irish famine,”
was disposed of at speculation prices, and
the state went on to prosperity and comparative
excellence and influence.</p>

<p>The mass of descendants of pioneers in Ohio
looked forward to agriculture as the source of
subsistence and independent competency. “Millionaire,”
in early days, was a word seldom
used, and entirely unknown in biography. The
pioneer saw the necessity for the promotion and
advancement of true civilization, that every citizen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
should own a home&mdash;a place he might call
his own&mdash;a place to live and labor for the good
of himself and others. And not until the introduction
of the railroad president, private palace
cars, trusts, combines, and transformation of the
public service into party machines for becoming
suddenly rich, did the more observing recognize
the true estimate and sound brotherhood existing
with the gold bags of the nation. Nor did the
poor suspect that combined wealth would ever
dream as did the thirsting Turk at midnight
hour&mdash;“that Liberty, her knee in suppliance
bent, should tremble at its power.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">OHIO&mdash;HER RAILROAD AND TELEGRAPH ERA.</span></h2>


<p>The canal era proved so satisfactory that people
took their steps more rapidly than ever before,
and began measuring the hours by dollars and
cents, and the value of life by the amount of
labor performed. The feeling that something
should be done to increase time and diminish
space became universal, and not a few prospectors
had their eyes open for the “old stone”
that turned all it touched to gold.</p>

<p>The application of steam as the coming motor
power for transportation and travel was pictured
in the minds of many inventors in this country and
in Europe; and trials of engines and their working
abilities became the all-absorbing subject of
the times, and as early as 1835 it could be seen
that provincialism was passing away and that the
citizens of Ohio felt that coaches, wagons and
canal-boats were too slow and insufficient for advanced
civilization.</p>

<p>The opening of a road between Manchester
and Liverpool, September 15, 1830, and one in
South Carolina the following January, gave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
subject increased interest, although the efforts
were exceedingly crude, and often bordering on
the ridiculous. It was, however, a problem that
had to be worked out, and every one having a
mind for construction became a model maker of
locomotives and railroad tracks. Even Peter
Cooper built an engine and named it “Tom
Thumb,” and in his attempt to test its superiority
over horse-power was beaten owing to that
“if” which always catches the rear contestant.
It appears that in 1830 the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
road had a double track finished from Baltimore
to Ellicott’s Mills, a distance of fifteen miles, and
was utilized by means of horse-power. Mr.
Cooper, who had built a small locomotive after
his own mind to demonstrate to his own satisfaction
the possibilities of steam as a motor power
on roads, after making a number of successful
trips to the mills and return, a race was proposed
between “Tom Thumb” and its light open car,
and a car and one horse of those run by the company
occupying the road. The race was to start
at the Relay House and end in Baltimore, a
distance of nine miles.</p>

<p>On the 28th day of August, 1830, just seventeen
days before the Manchester and Liverpool
Exhibition, the start was made, and, as reported
at the time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At first the gray had the best of it, for his
steam would be applied to the greatest advantage
on the instant, while the engine had to wait until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the rotation of the wheels set the blower to work.
The horse was perhaps a quarter of a mile ahead
when the safety valve of the engine lifted, and
the thin blue vapor issuing from it showed an excess
of steam. The blower whistled, the steam
blew off in vapory clouds, the pace increased;
the passengers shouted, the engine gained on the
horse; soon it lapped him; the silk was plied;
the race was ‘neck-and-neck, nose-and-nose;’ then
the engine passed the horse, and a great hurrah
hailed the victory. But it was not repeated, for
just at this time, when the gray’s master was
about giving up, the band which draws the pulley
which moved the blower slipped from the
drum, the safety-valve ceased to scream, and the
engine, for want of breath, began to wheeze and
pant. While Mr. Cooper, who was his own engineer
and fireman, lacerated his hands in vain attempts
to replace the band upon the wheel, the horse
gained on the machine and passed it, and although
the band was presently replaced and steam again
did its best, the horse was too far ahead to be
overtaken, and came in the winner of the race.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The numerous excursions, trial trips of engines,
and public demonstrations made in the interests
of improvements, from 1830 to 1840, on
roads chartered in 1825-26-27-28, did not inspire
confidence as good investments. They were
looked upon chiefly as curiosities, mixed with
great discomfort and danger, and received huzzahs
and new patrons at each juncture, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
making the trip one day surrendering their places
with admiration to others, much after the plan of
those who took in the curiosity show of the
horse “having his tail where his head ought to
be.” A railroad excursion of governors, senators,
judges, lawyers, divines, doctors, and other
good people&mdash;special guests of several hundred&mdash;to
ride on strap-iron rails, housed in old coach
bodies or on open platform boxes, with the bumping
and jerking of trucks attached to each other
by abundance of slack chain, a beer-bottle engine
and pine knots to make steam, enables the imagination
to see the likeness of the unfortunate colored
fireman with respect, though a slave, for the
exhibition of a sense of comfort before, if not
after, he “punched up the fire and closed down
the lever to the safety-valve and sat upon it to
keep the steam and smoke out of his eyes.”</p>

<p>While great enthusiasm existed in favor of
railroads every-where during the thirties, the
moneyed man and the man who desired to travel
with comfort regardless of time did not take
much stock in the enterprise. And the gentleman
who wrote the following in his diary was
one of a large class who viewed the present as
complete, and that they could not endure pleasantly
any discomfort that might repay to others
in the future great pleasure:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<em>July 22, 1835.</em>&mdash;This morning at nine o’clock
I took passage in a railroad car (from Boston)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
for Providence. Five or six other cars were attached
to the locomotive, and uglier boxes I do
not wish to travel in. They were made to stow
away some thirty human beings who sit, cheek
by jowl, as best they can. The poor fellows who
were not much in the habit of making their
toilet squeezed me into a corner, while the hot
sun drew from their garments a villainous compound
of smells made up of salt fish, tar and
molasses. By and by, just twelve&mdash;only twelve&mdash;bouncing
factory girls were introduced, who
were going on a party of pleasure to Newport.
‘Make room for the ladies!’ bawled out the superintendent.
‘Come, gentlemen, jump up on the
top, plenty of room there.’ ‘I’m afraid the
bridge knocking my brains out,’ said a passenger.
Some made one excuse and some another. For
my part, I flatly told him that since I belonged
to the Corps of Silver Grays, I had lost my gallantry,
and did not intend to move. The whole
twelve were, however, introduced, and soon made
themselves at home, sucking lemons and eating
green apples. The rich and the poor, the educated
and the ignorant, the polite and the vulgar,
all herd together in this modern improvement in
traveling. The consequence is a complete amalgamation.
Master and servant sleep heads and
points on the cabin floor of the steamer, feed at
the same table, sit in each other’s laps as it were
in the cars; and all this for the sake of doing
very uncomfortably in two days what would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
done delightfully in eight or ten. Shall we be
much longer kept by this toilsome fashion of
hurrying, hurrying, from starting (those who
can afford it) on a journey with our own horses,
and moving slowly, surely and profitably through
the country, with the power of enjoying its
beauty, and be the means of creating good inns?
Undoubtedly a line of post-horses and post-chaises
would long ago have been established
along our great roads had not steam monopolized
every thing.</p>

<p>“Talk of <em>ladies</em> on board a steamboat or in a
railroad car&mdash;<em>there are none</em>. I never feel like a
gentlemen there, and I can not perceive a semblance
of gentility in any one who makes part of
the traveling mob. When I see women whom,
in their drawing-rooms or elsewhere, I have been
accustomed to respect and treat with every
suitable deference&mdash;when I see them, I say, elbowing
their way through a crowd of dirty emigrants,
or low-bred homespun fellows in petticoats
or breeches in our country, in order to
reach a table spread for a hundred or more, I
lose sight of their pretentions to gentility, and
view them as belonging to the plebeian herd. To
restore herself to her caste, let a lady move in
select company at five miles an hour, and take
her meals in comfort at a good inn, where she
may dine decently. After all the old-fashioned
way of five or six miles, with liberty to dine
decently in a decent inn, and be master of one’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
movements, with the delight of seeing the
country and getting along rationally, is the mode to
which I cling, and which will be adopted again
by the generations of after times.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Information in regard to railroading in its true
sense, was circumscribed to experiment, which
retarded the progress of improvement. The belief
in lasting solidity, making the expense of
building the road-bed more than necessary, so
much so that it was estimated in the Eastern
States, that about ten miles a year were all one
company could properly construct.</p>

<p>Most engineers at first fell into the same error&mdash;making
heavy stone walls for the road-bed. The
blocks into which the wooden plugs were driven
for the spikes to hold the rails were frequently
resting upon solid masonry, four feet high and two
and a half feet wide. After done, it was discovered
a mistake; that an inelastic road-bed and
speed were incompatible and disastrous to the
machinery, and the intelligent State of Massachusetts,
from the time the first locomotive was
put upon the track (March, 1834) until 1841,
had shown little advancement in the proper application
of steam, as well as construction of
road-beds and rails.</p>

<p>Robert Fulton expected his discovery would
find its highest usefulness as a motive-power on
railroads, as it has done; but his brother-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and partner did not deem the thing practicable
as long as the insuperable objections named existed,
and all attempts were passed to others, as
the following letter shows, with day and date:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="ir2">“<span class="smcap">Albany</span>, March 1st, 1811,</p>

<p>“<em>Dear Sir</em>: I did not until yesterday receive
yours of February 25th; where it has been loitering
on the road I am at a loss to say. I had before
read of your very ingenious proposition as
to the railway communications. I fear, however,
on mature reflection, that they will be liable to
serious objection, and ultimately more expensive
than a canal. They must be double, so as to
prevent the danger of two such bodies meeting.
The walls on which they are to be placed should
at least be four feet below the surface and three
feet above, and must be clamped with iron, and
even then would hardly sustain so heavy a weight
as you propose moving at the rate of four miles
an hour on wheels. As to wood, it would not
last a week. They must be covered with iron, and
that, too, very thick and strong. The means of
stopping these heavy carriages without great
shock, and of preventing them from running on
each other&mdash;for there would be many running on
the road at once&mdash;would be very difficult. In
cases of accidental stops to take wood and water,
etc., many accidents would happen. The carriage
of condensing water would be very troublesome.
Upon the whole, I fear the expense would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
be much greater than that of canals, without
being so convenient.</p>

<p class="ir2">“<span class="smcap">R. R. Livingston.</span>”</p></blockquote>

<p>Ordinary business men, and even accomplished
engineers, manifested as little knowledge in regard
to the principles of science in railroading as
they did in regard to the telegraph. Both were
new fields for experiment, and both operators
made many ridiculous mistakes.</p>

<p>When William D. Wesson announced he would
demonstrate the practicability of sending and receiving
messages over his wires stretched on
poles from Chillicothe to Columbus, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice
versa</i>, many persons had business into the city on
that day, but ostensibly to witness the wonderful
performance.</p>

<p>Early in the morning advertised for free messages,
an honest patron of science living on the
line a short distance out of town went up one of
the poles and hung a letter on the wire, and secreted
himself in view of the missive and in vain
watched it all day, that he might obtain the secret
of the process.</p>

<p>Another individual of inquiring mind on his
way to the city boasted he intended to know
before he returned how the thing was done.
On his way home he was accosted by a neighbor
who wished to know how it was possible to send
a message to Columbus with safety on one of
those little wires. The Squire said to <em>himself it
was no longer a mystery</em>&mdash;he was a justice of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
peace, and above the average as a lawyer&mdash;saying:
“You see, they have a machine that rolls
and compresses a letter into a little bit of an
oblong roll, which just fits into a little brass cylinder,
and when ready to send it is pushed up to
a kind of machine all full of cog-wheels and
ticking clock-work, and the man at the head
says, ‘All ready&mdash;go’&mdash;and he touches a button,
and the electricity runs out on the wire, and
strikes the head of the cylinder in which the letter
is placed, and it goes, <em>chebang</em>, to the other
end of the wire, and drops into a basket.”</p>

<p>All this was worked out by the mental process
of the Squire, who actually believed he had solved
the process of telegraphing, as much as the engineers
did that of railroading when they constructed
the track of solid masonry.</p>

<p>In 1837, the horse-car running from Toledo to
Adrian, Michigan, on oak rails was remodeled,
road-bed improved in grades, rails strapped, an
engine to take the place of horses, “and a beautiful
new passenger coach to supply that of the
old coach bodies.” It was also advertised the
road would be “running regularly on and after
October 1, 1837,” and that the “speed would be
greatly increased, and would be able to carry
passengers and the United States mail at the
rate of fifteen miles an hour, making the entire
distance, thirty miles, in two hours.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">New Passenger Car on the Toledo &amp; Adrian Ry. 1837.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A fair likeness of the new passenger coach is
<a href="#Ref_320">here given</a>, which, in days of primitive railroading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
was looked upon as a step in the right direction.
But this road was soon obliged to again
suspend operations, temporarily, for other
changes&mdash;many discouragements stood in the
pathway to prosperity. Strap-iron rails on parallel
timbers and stonemasonry and solidity
proved failures, and the locomotive added no advantage
over the horse, as existing conditions
would not tolerate great velocity, the very thing
in chief that would insure supremacy over a
canal.</p>

<p>And England was twenty years in search of an
adjustment of road and machinery by which velocity
could be increased without an increase of
danger. But the discouragements were so numerous,
many hopeful workers abandoned the
field. Only six years previous to George Stephenson’s
locomotive, “Rocket,” making twenty-nine
and a half miles in an hour, a book was published
on “Railways,” in which the author says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
“That nothing could do more harm toward the
adoption of railways than the promulgation of
such nonsense, as that we shall see locomotive
engines traveling at the rate of twelve, sixteen,
eighteen, and twenty miles an hour.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>This may have been intended for Americans
as well as Mr. Stephenson, for the “promulgation
of such nonsense” did not cease, and power and
speed increased with the increase in size of the
parts of the machinery insured. So rapidly
was this increase, that strong attempts were
made from time to time to fix a legal limit at
some point below twenty miles&mdash;in England.</p>

<p>In the United States, however, the faster the
better, and from five rose to fifty, and then began
looking around for rails and road-bed that
would withstand the racket.</p>

<p>All the expense and experiments were not
thrown away; true, investments and results
failed for many years to inspire that confidence
which opens the money vaults of the capitalists,
but, not in the least discouraged, artisans, scientists,
and genius, under any and every name,
worked on and on, and when asked gave the coalminer’s
answer to the House of Commons: “I
<em>can’t</em> tell you <em>how</em> I’ll do it, but I <em>can</em> tell you I
<em>will</em> do it.” The engineers, machinists, and
model-makers kept at work, and so many improvements
had been suggested to Peter Cooper’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
locomotive that the first thing of the kind that
had ever been made in the United States became
transformed from a little competitor of the horse
into a mammoth institution breathing impatiently
for a track on which might be tested its speed
and wondrous power.</p>

<p>The locomotive came&mdash;the heavy iron rails
were in sight&mdash;but no one had yet suggested a
satisfactory road-bed and rests for the rails. It had
baffled the attempts of engineers. At this critical
juncture a voice was heard from the wilderness&mdash;an
axman, an Ohio “Squirrel Hunter”&mdash;one who
had constructed many miles of substantial wagon
roads through new sections of marshy country
by means of “corduroys”&mdash;placing pieces of split
timber, or sections of a younger growth, sixteen
feet long, in close contact at right angles to the line
of intended road-bed, then pinning long pieces of
split saplings on the upper surface near the ends
of the cross-ties on either side, and filling the interstices
with earth, gravel, rotten wood, or
other material, making a substantial and elastic
track.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the president and directors of a
section of unsatisfactory strap-iron road, this man
appeared before the board with a model showing
the relations of road-bed, cross-ties, and rails as
now in use, claiming the plans proposed would insure
the desirable essentials to safety, speed, cheapness,
and durability, by giving elasticity and securing
an absolute gauge at high rates of speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing the model, and hearing the common-sense
arguments and practicable philosophy of
the “Squirrel Hunter,” all present clapped their
hands and cried&mdash;“Eureka!”</p>

<p>Before the close of the session, a resolution
was adopted in favor of “cross-ties and heavy
iron rails.” With the correct idea for construction,
it required but little time to satisfy
the most credulous that velocity and power could
be obtained with safety, and <em>time</em> saved; for <em>time</em>
was fast becoming an important factor in the
prosperity of the state. Charters were granted
for roads in every direction, and each important
village had aspirations for “a railroad center;”
and capital, by millions, flowed into the state,
and in a short period Ohio found herself with
eight thousand five hundred miles of railroad,
representing a capital of more than five hundred
and fifty million dollars.</p>

<p>The officers of the first railroads felt or seemed
to feel and act like ordinary people. This, however,
was long before the procuration of a prohibitory
tax on foreign steel rails. On one occasion,
in 1849, the passengers on the line of
coaches from the South, bound for Cleveland,
Ohio, found on arrival at Columbus that “a new
and expeditious route” had just been opened to
Sandusky City, and thence to Cleveland, Buffalo,
and other points east and west.</p>

<p>This “new and expeditious line” consisted of
stage-coaches from Columbus to Mansfield, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Mansfield to Sandusky <em>by the new railroad</em>, and
thence by boat to all other points. The railroad
was part of the incomplete first through line
from the lakes to the Ohio river, and was completed
from Sandusky to Mansfield, fifty miles.
The writer was one of the second installment of
passengers sent over the new route. Four coaches
left Columbus at an early hour, loaded with
passengers and baggage, to make the connection
at Mansfield, nearly seventy miles, over rough
mud roads.</p>

<p>All went well until the Delaware county corduroys
were reached. Here the leading coach got
off the track and was down, with one wheel in the
mud up to the hub. Getting out of this difficulty
caused the time-table to be broken, and on
reaching Mansfield in the evening we found the
train to Sandusky had just left&mdash;so recently that
the smoke of the motor was still visible in the
direction of the lake.</p>

<p>The arrival of this caravan created no little excitement
in the small town of Mansfield (Secretary
Sherman’s home). Thirty angry passengers
to be detained until the next day at a fifth-class
hotel, destitute of accommodations, was not
considered in the storm of invectives that were
hurled in every direction, after taking in the situation.
Accusations were publicly made that the
landlord and the directors of the railroad were
in partnership to rob the public by assertions enticing
them into this trap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>The party was in no mood to remain idle, and
at once took possession of the large room called
“the parlor,” elected a chairman, adopted resolutions,
and made a report and placed it in the
hands of the printer, headed with familiar English
epithets, warning the public to shun this
impious swindle&mdash;making the most imposing
specimen of literature, on large sheets, ever
printed in that highly-intelligent town.</p>

<p>Before eleven o’clock that night the bill-posters
had finished their work, as no more space could
be found on which to spread the attractive sheets.
About this time four good-looking, elderly gentlemen
appeared and announced that they represented
the president and directors of the road;
that they were sorry the break of connection had
occurred; that such a thing would not occur
again, and asked, if they should reimburse all
the fares paid at Columbus and give each a
through ticket to place of destination, and pay
the hotel expenses while detained in Mansfield,
would the party surrender all the posters in their
possession and call it even?</p>

<p>This was agreed to&mdash;posters surrendered and
fares adjusted, and the whole party invited to a
well-prepared but unexpected supper, which
wound up with a jolly good time, and the dissatisfied
were sent on their way next morning in
full praise of the “new arrangement,” which became
the most popular and best-patronized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
through fare route of any previous combination
of the kind ever made in Ohio.</p>

<p>Railroads developed their importance rapidly,
as did also the officers and employes. The systematic
training and experimental management
of roads have accomplished wonders in nationalizing
the people of the United States. And by
the reports of the Commissioner of “Railroads
and Telegraph,” no necessity exists any longer
for Ohio roads to <em>compromise</em> or give <em>drawbacks</em> to
patrons in order to hold their influence and business.
At least it would seem so, when the roads
within the state, in 1894, carried twenty-seven
million, two hundred and thirty-one thousand
passengers, and fifty-nine millions, six hundred
and thirty-nine tons of freight&mdash;earning sixty
million, one hundred and forty thousand, eight
hundred and thirty-one dollars; giving employment
to fifty-four thousand, seven hundred persons,
whose salaries amounted to a fraction less
than thirty million, six hundred thousand dollars
in aggregate. All this great wealth and industry
has arisen from exceedingly small and crude
beginnings.</p>

<p>Profitable private enterprises resulting from
railroad investments in the states, at the commencement
of the fifties, awakened a dozing
Congress to the national importance of the subject,
and in 1853, the Government commenced a
road at an estimated cost that would have made
the head of a Thomas Jefferson swim with constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
objections&mdash;involving an expenditure
of one hundred and thirty millions, with an
additional five millions for engineering. It
proved a success; the expenditure of <em>labor</em> enriched
the people, and the road helped save the
United States as a nation.</p>

<p>With canals, railroads, turnpikes, large crops,
quick and cheap transportation, growing cities
and increasing knowledge, wealth and happiness,
to Ohio the sky was clear overhead, and every
thing prosperous, West, East and North, until
1860. Something was transpiring South&mdash;Northern
men were returning from the slave states
with the belief the country was on the verge of
a civil war&mdash;a gigantic insurrection. Some, to
whom such opinions were rendered, believed,
but most Northern men made light of the idea
of the South seceding, as there appeared no justifiable
cause for secession or rebellion.</p>

<p>But there was that quarrel about the black
spot on the face of the Goddess of Liberty, which
had grown large and was giving pain and mortification
to all her Northern friends. It was evident
the disease was destroying the life as it had the
beauty, unless something was done to remove or
check its growth.</p>

<p>Consultation after consultation had from time to
time been made by the wise men of the nation,
ending in disagreement in regard to the etiology,
pathology and treatment. Still it was evident,
to both North and South, that something must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
be done. And the South, claiming the patient,
assured the country the affection and disaffection
could be removed by the law of nature Samuel
Hahnemann made&mdash;“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">similia similibus curantur</i>,”
and retired with the intention to capture Washington
before the North could make resistance,
and then proclaim the slave-power, the true and
lawful friend of Liberty, and insist upon a hasty
recognition of the Government of the United
States, by the foreign ministers at the federal
capital and the leading powers of Europe. But
the Southern blood could not be restrained, and
the premature overt acts defeated the scheme,
saved Washington, and led to the recovery of
universal freedom in the United States through a
prolonged and bloody law.</p>

<p>General Sherman says in regard to the cause
of the War of the Rebellion, that “The Southern
statesmen, accustomed to rule, began to perceive
that the country would not always submit to be
ruled by them;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and they believed slavery could
not thrive in contact with freedom; and they had
come to regard slavery as essential to their <em>political</em>
and <em>social existence</em>. Without a slave caste
they could have no aristocratic caste....
That the northern politicians, accustomed to follow
the lead of their southern associates generally, believed
that the defeat of Fremont, in 1856, as the
Republican candidate for the presidency, had insured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the perpetuity of the Union; the southern
politicians, generally, believed that the date of
its dissolution was postponed during the next
presidential term, and that four years and a facile
President were given them to prepare for it.
And they began to do so.</p>

<p>“Accordingly, during Mr. Buchanan’s administration,
there was set on foot throughout the
Southern States a movement embodying the reorganization
of the militia, the establishment
and enlargement of state military academies, and
the collection of arms, ammunition, and warlike
materials of all kinds.</p>

<p>“The Federal Secretary of War, Mr. Floyd,
thoroughly in the interests of the pro-slavery
conspirators, aided them by sending to the
arsenals in the slave states large quantities of
the national arms and military supplies; the
quotas of the Southern States under the militia
laws were anticipated in some cases by several
years; and he caused large sales of arms to be
secretly made, at low prices, to the agents of
those states.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>“The pro-slavery leaders then began, quietly,
to select and gather around them the men whom
they needed and upon whom they thought they
could rely.</p>

<p>“Among the men they fixed upon was Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Sherman.... It was explained to him
that the object of establishing the State Military
Academy at Alexandria, was to aid in suppressing
negro insurrections, to enable the state to protect
her borders, ... and to form a nucleus for
defense in case of an attack by a foreign enemy.”</p>

<p>Captain Sherman did not remain long in his
high salaried office before he saw enough to convince
an intelligent mind war was near at hand,
and on January 18, 1861, he sent in his resignation
to the Governor, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: As I occupy a quasi-military position
under this state, I deem it proper to acquaint you
that I accepted such position when Louisiana was
a state in the Union, and when the motto of the
seminary, inserted in marble over the main door,
was: ‘By the liberality of the general Government
of the United States&mdash;the Union&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Esto
Perpetua</i>.’ Recent events foreshadow a great
change, and it becomes all men to choose. If
Louisiana withdraws from the Federal Union, I
prefer to maintain my allegiance to the old Constitution
as long as a fragment of it survives, and
my longer stay here would be wrong in every
sense of the word. In that event, I beg you will
send or appoint some authorized agent to take
charge of the arms and munitions of war here,
belonging to the state, or direct me what disposition
should be made of them.</p>

<p>“And furthermore, as president of the board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
of supervisors, I beg you to take immediate steps
to relieve me as superintendent the moment the
state determines to secede, for on no earthly account
will I do an act, or think any thought,
hostile to or in defiance of the old Government
of the United States.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Up to this date, Captain Sherman was not much
known as a lawyer or statesman, and as a military
genius, the South found they had mis-measured
his patriotism and that which constituted his
make-up. Few, if any, had heard the reply of
the little fatherless boy to the minister who
hesitated to give him the name of “a heathen,”
(<em>Tecumseh</em>,) in baptism.</p>

<p>“My father called me Tecumseh, and Tecumseh
I’ll be called&mdash;If you won’t, I’ll not have any of
your baptism.”</p>

<p>This was the character of General Sherman,
whose talents were as bright as was his life, pure
and courageous. At the commencement of the
war he was assailed on all sides, by the petty jealousies
indigenous to public life; but nothing
could retard his progress to the front, any more
than it could his march to the sea&mdash;one of Ohio’s
legitimate “Squirrel Hunters” born with his
hand on Esau’s heel.</p>

<p>The war came, and on the 12th day of April,
1861, the first gun was fired. The Government
was not alarmed, but was firm in the determination
to preserve the Union at all cost, and looked
upon the prospects of final success of secession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
as impossible against the will of the vast population
and resources of the North-western States,
and held to the truth of General Jackson’s
answer to Calhoun: “Secession is treason, and
the penalty for treason is death.”</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Rebellion, the State of
Kentucky had a governor named Beriah Magoffin.
He had by some unknown means escaped the
familiar Kentucky military title, and was known
simply as “Beriah Magoffin, the Secessionist.”
Beriah concocted a brilliant scheme, and gave out
a manifesto that “Kentucky will not sever connection
from the National Government, nor take
up arms for either belligerent party, but arm
herself for the preservation of peace within her
borders, and a mediator to effect a just and honorable
peace.”</p>

<p>But when the President of the United States
called on Kentucky for volunteers to defend the
Union, he received the reply: “I say emphatically
that Kentucky will furnish no troops for the
wicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern
States.” On hearing of the reply of Governor
Beriah Magoffin, the Governor of Ohio immediately
telegraphed the War Department, “If Kentucky
will not fill her quota, Ohio will fill it for
her.” And within two days, two regiments were
on the road to the credit of Kentucky, and other
regiments came in so rapidly, that within a few
days after the announcement of quotas, the Adjutant-General
stated the offers of troops from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Ohio were enough to fill the full quota of
seventy-five thousand men allotted to the entire
country.</p>

<p>The people of Ohio, and especially some in Cincinnati,
became indignant at the muddle in which
Kentucky had placed herself, causing Cincinnati
to occupy an extra-hazardous position. The
Governors of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois foresaw
the tempting prize Cincinnati would be to the
Confederates, and early urged the policy of seizing
Louisville, Paducah, Columbus, Covington,
Newport and the railroads. But this wise suggestion
was postponed in its execution for want
of troops, until the opportunity became lost.
Columbus was strongly garrisoned, Buckner had
committed his treason, Bowling Green was fortified,
Tennessee was gone, and Kentucky held
back all the armies of the West until March,
1862.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Still, for the kindness, Kentucky came near
getting Ohio into trouble during the second
year of the war. And this, too, at a time when
the Union forces were scattered and <a id="Ref_333"></a>disseminated
by disasters, disease, and desertions until the
War Department showed an inability to maintain
many important positions, especially in the
border states. Rebel raids were moving in
several directions. John Morgan, with his cavalry,
found the City of Cincinnati defenseless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
and virtually besieged. Rough secession citizens
were rioting, mobbing, and destroying property
of peaceable persons of African descent, requiring
“one thousand” extra policemen to save
enough of the boodle to make an inducement
for rebel raiders to call that way.</p>

<p>The cultivated hatred and unlawful acts
toward the colored race prevailed to such a large
extent by Cincinnati rebels and sympathizers,
that the sentiments of officials were so uncertain
that, when danger was in sight and the city
came under the management of men who had
actually taken side with the Federal Government,
the police were required to take the oath
of allegiance in a body as their official certificate
of loyalty.</p>

<p>The rebel element was disappointed that John
Morgan and cavalry did not attempt to take the
city, which was joy and gladness to the Union
portion of the inhabitants. But new and more
alarming trouble to the loyal citizen was approaching.
The Union forces had just met
with disaster at Richmond, and General Kirby
Smith had entered Lexington with Morgan and
started an army for Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Bragg was just crossing the Kentucky line for
Louisville, and no time could be lost. Cincinnati
was without preparation or means of defense,
and all was literally blue around recruiting offices;
government troops were powerless, for want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
time, and the emergency was great, for the rebels
were near at hand.</p>

<p>If the Federal forces were ever at any time
subject to despondency and discouragements it
would have been excusable during July and August
of 1862. General McClellan had been recalled
from the Peninsula, Pope driven back
and forced to seek refuge in the defenses of Washington,
raids were menacing the borders of the
free states, and many were claiming the war “a
failure.”</p>

<p>General Wallace had been placed in command
for the protection of the cities of Cincinnati,
Covington, and Newport, and arrived in Cincinnati
at nine o’clock at night, September 1st.
And after consultation with Governor Tod and
the mayors of the above-named cities, wrote his
proclamation of <em>martial</em> law, and after midnight
sent it to the city papers.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the Governor was
busily engaged at the telegraph station. He
knew the power and the loyalty of the “Squirrel
Hunters.” As one of their number, he asked
them to come&mdash;to come without delay, and to come
armed&mdash;and then telegraphed to the Secretary
of War, that a large rebel force was moving
against Cincinnati, “but it would <em>be</em> successfully
met.” He had faith in the expected troops.
Though fresh from the rural districts, they all
knew how to shoot; all fellow “Squirrel Hunters,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
never known to turn their backs to the
enemy with the trusty rifle in hand.</p>

<p>History tells the result. Whitelaw Reid says
of the next morning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Before daybreak the advance of the men that
were thenceforward to be known in the history
of the state as the ‘Squirrel Hunters’ were filing
through the streets.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The citizens knew little or nothing of what
had been transpiring throughout the night, and
when aroused by the tramp, tramp, tramp, and
as they gazed out upon the dimly-lighted streets,
the greater their wonderment grew. Armed
men, with all shades, colors, and kinds of uniforms!
No one, awakening from sweet slumber,
could say from what country, place, or planet,
such a vast multitude could have dropped during
the night. It could be seen the army was not
<em>blue</em> enough for federals, nor <em>gray</em> enough for
rebels; and “good Lord, good devil,” was about
all that could be said.</p>

<p>In due time the morning papers came, announcing
the city under martial law and protected
by the “Squirrel Hunters” of Ohio, and
the excitement became so great that many expressed
themselves much after the fashion of
“the little woman who went to market all on a
market day.”</p>

<p>For patriotism, executive ability, and business
talents, Governor Tod had few equals. With him
the line of duty was always clear. Before General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Wallace had written his proclamation of
martial law the Governor was on his way to Cincinnati.
From this point he at once telegraphed
to the people, press, and military committees,
saying: “Our southern border is threatened with
invasion.... Gather up all the arms and
furnish yourselves with ammunition for the same....
The soil of Ohio must not be invaded
by the enemies of our glorious government. Do
not wait. <em>None but armed men will be received</em>.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“From morning till night the streets resounded
with the tramp of armed men, marching to the
defense of the city. From every quarter of the
state they came, in every form of organization,
with various species of arms. The ‘Squirrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Hunters,’ in their homespun, with powder-horn
and buckskin pouch, ... all poured out
from the railroad depots and down toward the
pontoon bridge. The ladies of the city furnished
provisions by the wagon load; the Fifth-street
market-house was converted into a vast free eating
saloon for the ‘Squirrel Hunters.’ Halls and
warehouses were used as barracks.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Pontoon Bridge, Ohio River.</p></div>
</div>

<p>As soon as it was known the city was under
martial law, the sounds of hammers and saws
came up from the river, and in a few hours a
pontoon bridge was stretched across to Covington,
and streams of wagons loaded with lumber
and other materials for fortifications were passing
over; and on the 4th of September Governor Tod
telegraphed to General Wright, commander of
the department: “I have now sent you for Kentucky
twenty regiments. I have twenty-one
more in process of organization,” and the next
day said to the press:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The response to my proclamation asking
volunteers for the protection of Cincinnati was
most noble and generous. All may feel proud of
the gallantry of the people of Ohio. No more
volunteers are required for the protection of Cincinnati.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The exertions of the city were, however, not
abated. Judge Dickson organized a colored
brigade for labor on the fortifications. This with
the daily details of three thousand white citizens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
composed of judges, lawyers, merchant princes,
clerks, day-laborers, artists, ministers, editors,
side by side, kept at work with the ax, spade,
pick, and shovel, and all promised the same
wages&mdash;a dollar per day&mdash;went on most enthusiastically.</p>

<p>The engineers had given shape to the fortifications.
General Wallace was vigilant night and
day, as the rebel forces gradually moved up as if
intending an attack. The Squirrel Hunters were
drilled during the day and manned the trenches
every night, and it was no longer a possibility
that the forces under General Kirby Smith could
take the city. But, owing to a few skirmishes,
Major-General Wright, commander of the department,
thought it prudent to call for more
“Squirrel Hunters,” as it was believed a general
engagement was near at hand. The papers of
the city, September 11th, announced that before
they were distributed the sound of artillery might
be heard on the heights of Covington, and advised
their readers to keep cool, as the city was
safe beyond question.</p>

<p>It was under these circumstances Governor Tod
sent the following telegram to “The Press of
Cleveland”&mdash;“To the several Military Committees
of Northern Ohio:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="ir2">“<span class="smcap">Columbus</span>, <em>Sept.</em> 10, 1862.</p>

<p>“By telegram from Major-General Wright,
commander-in-chief of Western forces, received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
at two o’clock this morning, I am directed to send
all armed men that can be raised immediately
to Cincinnati. You will at once exert yourselves
to execute this order. The men should be
armed, each furnished with a blanket and at least
two days’ rations. Railroad companies are requested
to furnish transportation of troops to the
exclusion of all other business.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The expected attack did not come. “General
Wallace gradually pushed out his advance a
little, and the Rebel pickets fell back. By the
11th, all felt that the danger was over. On the
12th, General Smith’s hasty retreat was discovered.
On the 13th, Governor Tod checked the movements
of the Squirrel Hunters, announced the
safety of Cincinnati, and expressed his congratulations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="ir2">“<span class="smcap">Columbus</span>, <em>September</em> 13, 1862.<br />
<span class="ir1">Eight o’clock <span class="smcap">A. M.</span></span></p>

<p>“<em>To the Press of Cleveland</em>:</p>

<p>“Copy of dispatch this moment received from
Major-General Wright, at Cincinnati: ‘The
enemy is retreating. Until we know more of
his intention and position, do not send any more
citizen-troops to this city.’” And the Governor’s
dispatch to the Cleveland Press, accompanying
the good news from Major-General Wright, says:
“The generous response from all parts of the
state to the recent call, has won additional renown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
for the people of Ohio. The news which
reached Cincinnati, that the patriotic men all
over the state were rushing to its defense, saved
our soil from invasion, and hence all good citizens
will feel grateful to the patriotic men who
promptly offered their assistance.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The clear-minded Governor Tod, without
troops, guns or works of defense, telegraphed
the Secretary of War that a large Rebel force
was moving on Cincinnati, “<em>but it, would be
successfully met</em>;” thirteen days after wired the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="ir2">“<span class="smcap">Columbus</span>, <em>September</em> 13, 1862.</p>

<p>“<em>To Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War,<br />
<span class="il2">Washington, D. C</span></em>.</p>

<p>“The Squirrel Hunters responded gloriously to
the call for the defense of Cincinnati&mdash;thousands
reached the city, and thousands more were en
route for it. The enemy having retreated, all
have been ordered back. This uprising of the
people is the cause of the retreat. You should
acknowledge <em>publicly</em> this gallant conduct.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The entire North-west resounded with praises
for Governor Tod and his thoughtful and successful
expedient. To the “Squirrel Hunters,” it
was not an entirely new thing; they had often
heard of the times when their fathers were the
actors at Cleveland, Fort Meigs and the Miamies,
and bore their honors with a degree of modesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
becoming their military equipments. When
Lewis Wallace, Major-General commanding, bid
these gallant men farewell, he said: “In coming
time, strangers viewing the works on the hills of
Newport and Covington, will ask, ‘Who built
these intrenchments?’<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> You can answer&mdash;‘We
built them.’ If they ask ‘Who guarded them?’
You can reply&mdash;‘We helped in thousands.’ If
they inquire the result, your answer will be&mdash;‘The
enemy came and looked at them, and stole away
in the night.’ You have won much honor; keep
your organizations ready to win more. The
people of Ohio appreciated this noble act of the
‘Squirrel Hunters,’ in saving the City of Cincinnati,
by turning back the Rebel army and prevented
the destruction of property by a dissolute
and desperate army.”</p>

<p>And the Ohio Legislature, at its next session
adopted the following resolution:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, By the Senate and House of Representatives
of the State of Ohio, That the Governor
be and he is hereby authorized and directed
to appropriate out of his contingent fund a sufficient
sum to pay for printing and lithographing
discharges for the patriotic men of the state who
responded to the call of the governor and went
to the southern border to repel the invader, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
will be known in history as ‘The Squirrel

<p>A year after the services were performed, fifteen
thousand seven hundred and sixty-six were
issued to Squirrel Hunters, which, however, did
not embrace more than one-third of the number
that responded to the call and took part in the
defense of Cincinnati and the Kentucky cities.</p>

<p>Those with certificates and those having none,
but who responded to the call, are no less
“Squirrel Hunters,” descendants of the Spirit of
’76&mdash;a chosen people to maintain and perpetuate
the model government of the world.</p>

<p>From the Declaration of Independence to the
present time the power of this free people has
been as manifestly directed by unseen forces as
ever was that of the favorite nation which came
out from Egypt under a cloud; and the influences
which dictated the dedication of the North-west
to freedom will not likely permit the purpose
to be compromised or changed.</p>

<p>That which was considered a long duration
of the war, with frequent calls for troops, became
exceedingly discouraging. And it was evident,
after two years, that the strength of the federal
army was inadequate for successful offensive
operations. At the beginning of 1863, it required
nearly four hundred thousand recruits to fill the
companies and regiments then in service up to
the standard enumeration. Death, disaster, and
desertion begat inactivity, with an apparent exhaustion
of former volunteer supplies; and secession
was becoming more noisy and defiant in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
all the loyal states. This condition of things
brought out the conscript act, and under it the
Provost-Marshal General’s Bureau was organized
June 1, 1863, by James B. Fry, and early in 1864,
this efficient officer and his assistants had the
loyal states well canvassed, and thoroughly organized,
to obtain all the men necessary to put down
the Rebellion. Each state was divided into districts;
each district was placed under the management
of commissioned officers, termed a Board
of Enrollment, consisting of a provost-marshal,
commissioner, and surgeon, whose business it was
to make a full and exact enrollment of all persons
liable to conscription under the law of March
3, 1863, and its amendments, showing a complete
exhibit of the military resources in men
over twenty and under forty-five years of age,
with the names alphabetically arranged, with description
of person and occupation in each sub-district.</p>

<p>The enrollment being cleared of persons having
manifest disability of a permanent character,
each sub-district (township or ward) was required
to furnish its assigned quota under calls for men,
whether the able-bodied individuals enrolled continued
to reside in that sub-district or not. Unless it
could be shown such person or persons were correctly
enrolled in another sub-district, were in the
service uncredited or credited to another sub-district,
the removal of residence could not relieve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
obligation of the sub-district where such person
or persons were enrolled.</p>

<p>This new arrangement at first was exceedingly
unpopular with rebel sympathizers in the loyal
states, but the bureau soon established a business
that impressed a belief in secession circles that
it was an energetic war measure that would soon
end the <em>unpleasantness</em>. This system of furnishing
soldiers showed many advantages over that
of voluntary enlistments. Large demands for
men could be met immediately, and at the same
time it made every citizen, whether loyal or disloyal,
equally interested in having the quotas
filled by means of bounties in order to avoid sub-district
drafts.</p>

<p>And from an enrollment of two million two
hundred and fifty-four thousand persons liable to
do military service, the bureau, in a brief period,
forwarded under calls of the government one million
one hundred and twenty thousand six hundred
and twenty-one able-bodied soldiers, and
with these, and those already in the field, the
would-be Southern Confederacy crumbled before
the federal power.</p>

<p>It cost the government for raising troops from
the commencement of the war until May 1, 1863,
the date the recruiting service was turned over
to the Provost-Marshal General’s Bureau, forty-six
million one hundred and twenty-four thousand
one hundred and sixty-two dollars, or <em>thirty-four</em>
dollars for each man, exclusive of pay or bounty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
while putting soldiers in the service under the
conscript act cost the government nothing. The
Provost-Marshal General neither asked nor received
an appropriation, but under the law he
made the bureau pay all attendant expenses, and
after paying out sixteen million nine hundred
and seventy-six thousand two hundred and eleven
dollars for recruiting over one million men and
capturing and forwarding seventy-six thousand
five hundred and twenty-six deserters (now
wards), General Fry turned into the Treasury
of the United States, to the credit of the bureau,
nine million three hundred and ninety thousand
one hundred and five dollars, all of which proved
a matter of great economy to the government,
while the recruiting of the army cost less than
one third as much as that adopted previous to
the organization of the bureau, and that without
cost to the government.</p>

<p>The draft-wheel and its uses were not the most
pleasant things to contemplate, and to soften down
the enactment Congress authorized recruiting in
Southern states, regardless of color or previous
condition, that by means of agents and liberal
bounties very little drafting would likely be necessary.
And it was soon discovered that blue
suits and muskets were quite becoming to the colored
man. “The shape of the cranium, the
length of the forearm, thinness of the gastrocnemius
muscles, and flatness of the feet,” all
disappeared at the War Office, and for which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
substituted, “He can be made a mechanical soldier
to great perfection, skilled in the use of
arms, and the machinery of tactics; and, by reason
of the obstinacy of his disposition and the
depth of his passions, may become most powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
in a charge or in resisting the onset of an
enemy.”</p>

<p>The race was tried and showed the better predictions
true. Slavery had woven prejudices
around the name and color, until the government,
under Lincoln, Stanton, Chase, and a Congress
of loyal states, could find no place or mustering
officer (previous to the operation of the
Provost Marshal General’s Bureau), short of
Massachusetts, that could make the man of color
ready to obey orders and use a gun. Nothing in
history gives a clearer view of the height and
depth of the degrading influences of the institution
upon those who were free than the treatment
of the loyal colored man and citizen during the
efforts of the government to save the Union.
Through fear or cowardice his proffered aid was
rejected at government recruiting offices, while
Massachusetts was procuring colored credit from
the loyal states at unusually small bounties.</p>

<p>It may have been so ordered; the diet may
have contained enough meat to offend. Still, the
colored troops got to the front before the war was
over, and did much in reinforcing the wasting
armies and lifting anxious sub-districts out of the
draft, as well as covering their race with glory
by their bravery and efficiency.</p>

<p>Persons placed in the service by means of the
draft-wheel generally procured substitutes&mdash;persons
not liable to draft&mdash;aliens and under-age individuals,
who, for three years’ service or during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the war, commanded one thousand dollars, while
the bounty for enlistments of those liable to draft
varied from three to five hundred dollars. During
the war much of the territory of Ohio was
unimproved woods, though thickly settled with
cabin civilization. These new settlements were
made by the descendants of original Squirrel
Hunters&mdash;persons born in the state, and with
this legacy generally established homes in new
counties, in the woods, with like primitive beginnings
to those of their ancestors. At the announcement
of secession they were ready to serve
their country, and it was from these newer and
poorer sections that Ohio obtained her volunteers&mdash;from
a hardy and efficient class of young
men, accustomed to active life and the use of the
gun.</p>

<p>The recruits from Ohio were chiefly volunteer
enlistments. This was manifestly so in the
Twelfth district, in which the author was personally
and officially interested. The district was
composed of Ross, Pickaway, Fairfield, Hocking,
Perry, and Pike counties, embracing sixty miles
in length of the fertile Scioto valley, containing
in 1860 one hundred and thirty-nine thousand
four hundred and fifty-six inhabitants, with a
corrected enrollment of eighteen thousand three
hundred and seventy-one persons liable to military
service. Of this enrollment, thirteen thousand
six hundred and twenty-eight were farmers,
and the remaining four thousand seven hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
and forty-three comprised persons of other occupations.</p>

<p>Taking this district as an average of the other
districts in the state, it shows the volunteers sent
to the front from Ohio were chiefly young men
born in the state&mdash;hardy and well-developed
<em>Squirrel Hunters</em>. Of seventeen hundred and
fifty-five volunteers forwarded by this district,
from July 4, 1864, to April 30, 1865, one thousand,
two hundred and twenty-nine were Ohio
boys, with an average of 23.77 years&mdash;the remaining
five hundred and twenty-six were from
twenty-four states and fifteen foreign countries,
with an average of 27.13 years. Notwithstanding
the more favorable age of the latter group
for physical development, the measurements stand
decidedly in favor of the Ohio born, and if adding
to the latter the nine hundred and eighty-seven
drafted men, natives of Ohio, the favorable difference
becomes still more apparent.</p>

<p>The Provost-Marshal General, in his report to
the War Department, states there was not a
single district in all the loyal states in which the
board of enrollment was free from the annoyance
of evil disposed persons hostile to the Government,
who were ever ready and willing to embarrass
its operation by stimulating resistance to
the draft or discouraging enlistments. It was
when the disloyal element experienced the firmness
and earnestness of the boards, and felt
the power behind them for the enforcement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the law, that they became co-laborers and most
successful recruiting agents. This was exceedingly
gratifying to the Government, and caused
the Provost-Marshal General to say to the Secretary
of War: “<em>I am confident there is no class
of public servants to whom the country is more
indebted for valuable services rendered than the
District Provost-Marshals and their associates, comprising
the Boards of Enrollment, by whose efforts the
army of the Union, which suppressed the Rebellion,
was mainly recruited.</em>” Still, Hon. Hoke Smith,
ex-Rebel and Secretary of the Interior, published
the information that these recruiting officers are
not pensionable under the disability act of Congress,
June 27, 1890, for the reason “<em>these officers
were not in the war</em>,” and so says the present
Commissioner of Pensions, Hon. Henry Clay Evens.
Autocratic decisions are sometimes quite at
variance with sound sense as well as suggestive
of one of ex-President Lincoln’s best stories.</p>

<p>It can not be said that the Ohio Squirrel
Hunters were not in the war, for not a few of
them were pensioned long before the ex-secretary
surrendered his arms of rebellion against the
Government he now fosters. The oppressors of
slavery in their wicked attempts to destroy the
Union, induced a war that brought with it incalculable
sorrow and suffering&mdash;a war that words
and figures fail to give an approximate realization
of its magnitude. Dollars can be measured
by millions, but the tears, heart aches and loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
of two hundred and eighty-seven thousand, seven
hundred and eighty-nine loyal men who gave their
lives for liberty, and are historically represented
by head-stones that whiten the national cemeteries,
can no more be estimated than can the
good that must forever flow to the United States
in wiping out the iniquitous chattel slavery.</p>

<p>Some persons are inclined to look upon the
evils following the war&mdash;dissolute legislation,
moral turpitude, and political party profligacy,
as neutralizing much if not the entire national
benefits acquired at the enormous cost of the
Rebellion. While it is possible, the corruption
following in the wake of protracted wars with
large armies may more than counterbalance the
good accomplished by successful military achievements,
it is to be hoped that the subjugation of
southern rebels, giving freedom to millions of
slaves, and showing to credulous monarchs the
ability of a republic to coerce obedience to the
constitution and laws, may ever for good outweigh
the evils following the war that accomplished
such everlasting benefits. That the laxity
complained of has greatly increased within
the last three decades can scarcely be questioned.
Every department of the government has been
more or less criticised for want of faithful performance.
No department has perhaps suffered
more in the confidence of the people than that
political plum styled “The interior.”</p>

<p>The just and honorable cause for pensioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
disabled soldiers soon became merged into politics,
and from head to foot the distance was
made short from fact to fraud. Noah’s Ark did
not exceed in variety with all the species of
beasts, birds, and creeping things, that of the
contents of the Pension Building with a single
species of ex parte creation. Applications of all
kinds, shapes, and forms. This has never appeared
unsatisfactory to that unscrupulous, unmentionable,
who is paid per head by the bureau
for the art of filing claims. He knows by experience
the wonderful ability of the institution
and its consulting politicians to overcome objection
and get the most angular cases through the
hole that leads to the public treasury.</p>

<p>If stated, it would scarcely be believed that
absolute fraud could find unrequited favor in an
office devoted to the most deserving of the nation&mdash;cases
as groundless as the following: After
enlisting, a <em>soldier</em> changed his mind, and when
called upon to report forwarded a joint affidavit of
himself and physician, in which was stated said
soldier had before and at the date of enlistment
permanent disabilities (naming them), which disqualified
him for military service, and that he
should have been rejected. (Soldiers at that
date were sent forward without regulation examination.)
Soldier received a discharge on the
affidavit and was happy.</p>

<p>In due time an application was made under
the arrears act, giving the diseases named in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
joint affidavit as having “occurred in the service
in line of duty.” In days of honest administration,
in looking up the history of the applicant in
the War Office, the affidavit was found and
placed with the file in the Pension Office.</p>

<p>This ended the case, and under several administrations
it slept with attempts at fraud. Perseverance
is said to be the road to success, and
by the stimulant of contingent fees intercession
was secured, and by management of <em>good</em> legal
advice the case was placed in the hands of a
“special examiner,” and went through without
the loss of a dollar, securing a small fortune in
<em>arrears</em>, but claiming the rating too low, and
making immediate application for <em>increase</em>.</p>

<p>It would seem improbable for the heads of the
bureau not to know and fully understand some
of the many instances of perjury and fraud that
passed current through the office. It is the old
rejected or suspended cases with large arrears
that are attractive and are <em>thoroughly investigated</em>
for new evidence. In this attempt parties generally
receive the courteous assistance of those
officially connected with the office. Even a medical
referee has been known to show great interest
in barefaced fraud, and give tips to aid in
getting such through the bureau successfully.
General Phil Sheridan, who was well informed in
regard to the contents of the great Pension Office,
was told the contents were safe, as the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
was fire-proof, and could never burn down, replied:
“That would be my serious objection to it.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding reports of corruption, fraud,
avarice, and greed for public plunder, which may
slow the advancing pace of civilization, there are
enough common people to preserve the nation&mdash;people
who worship not at the feet of the God of
Aaron; poor people; people who pay legal tribute
to the government; honest, stalwart standard-bearers
of morality, intelligence, and patriotism;
supporters of common-schools and churches;
people who are ever watchful of the interests of
the nation, protect the sanctity of the ballot-box,
and direct the legal machinery for the protection
of virtue and suppression of vice, possessing <em>salt</em>
with the savor of moral honesty that passes current
in business and social life.</p>

<p>The expressed will of the people is the law of
the land. It has made and amended constitutions;
by it black has become white; the bond
free; slaves, citizens. It has erected monuments;
built towns and cities; and in war and times of
peace has accomplished much for the good of all.
It has muzzled many of the national vices, and
given civilization long strides in the right direction.
And the spirit of the age should by law
hasten the end of growing political struggles for
place regardless of qualification.</p>

<p>It has become a matter of common report, and
one that is generally believed, that successful applicants
for office by the suffrage of the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
are but seldom as much interested in the welfare
of their constituents as they are in their own
sycophantic obedience to selfish bosses, who, under
party cover, willingly contribute of their
wealth to perpetuate a party power that assures
the gratification of their own greed for ill-gotten
gain.</p>

<p>Qualification is recognized as essential by law,
and lies at the foundation of civil and military
service. State laws require that teachers of common
schools furnish legal evidence of qualification
for the position. The commander of an
army must have a military education and qualification;
so, too, every appointment made through
the civil departments of the government, for a
short distance up the base, requires of the applicant
a certificate from a qualified board of censors, stating
that said applicant is in all respects fitted to
perform the duties of the position applied for.
This is termed <em>Civil and Military Service</em>, and has
been declared constitutional.</p>

<p>If so, why may not the people demand more?
If a little civil service meted out to those filling
subordinate positions is a benefit, why may not
the like treatment be accorded to all candidates
seeking national positions, by appointment or directly
from the people? It is admitted that civil
service is a matter of safety and efficiency in subordinate
civil positions. If so, it is not unreasonable
to suppose the salutary effects would be
infinitely greater if applied to the more responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
positions. Education and qualification for
all positions is the law of military government;
and most certainly similar requirements might
be made equally advantageous to the civil government.
Military government could not long
sustain existence without the service of prescribed
regulations. The commanding general
of the army obtains the high honor of the position
from his education and certified ability, and
efficiency as master of the science of war. The
President of the United States, being over all as
commander-in-chief, should be thoroughly versed
in the civil and military, as <em>Master of the Science
of Government</em>, not only of our own, but that of
every nation on earth.</p>

<p>There does not appear to be any sufficient reason
why a government civil service should not
exist and be as open to the election of coming
generations as that of law, medicine, literary or
other pursuits; and it is not saying a word too
much to urge the necessity for an institution
adapted to the civil as West Point is to the military
power, where persons having taken the degree
of A.M. may matriculate and qualify themselves
for the civil service, and obtain a certificate
of such qualification from the institution, having
a prescribed curriculum, requiring four years of
study to entitle one to examination for the honors
of graduation.</p>

<p>Individuals highly educated in the science
of government and the art of governing, fitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
for a field exclusively their own, would promote
an agreement upon the complex questions that
now agitate and endanger the peace of society by
keeping at fever heat party differences that are
magnified by designing politicians.</p>

<p>The high authority of the teachings of the
court of instructions, would define the policy and
give stability to the Government, and would remove
party press for office by incompetency. It
would also determine the exact relations between
the several departments of the Government, especially
how far the President has power to involve
the country in war against the will of
Congress by recognizing belligerency or independence
in cases in which Congress refused such
recognition.</p>

<p>As the nation increases in population and
number of states, it requires increased wisdom
and knowledge to rule and make the people
prosperous and happy. The great central region
lying between the Ohio river, Lakes and Mississippi
will ever be the <em>heart</em> of the Republic.
Within it are the life springs of three-fourths of
our country’s whole area. Nowhere in the United
States is there a basin of such vast extent, capable
of feeding so great a population. “<em>Hence
its destiny is to hold the balance of power between East
and West, hence it is truly regal.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>When the first-born of the states of this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
basin came into the Union (Ohio), it brought
with its baptism the inauguration of <em>National
Internal Improvements</em>&mdash;a policy <em>that has enriched
the nation by liberality</em> of expenditures, improving
harbors, water-ways and roads, in building custom-houses,
post-offices, and in assisting the
states in many laudable undertakings, while like
the miser, in all its vast wealth has been wearing
old, unbecoming, unfashionable clothes and doing
the business of the nation in rented and other
ill-begotten shops, located here and there, as best
suited real-estate sharks and speculators in a
sickly city.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> But the dawn of day is coming by
which the people of the North-west now see it is
high time the Government should make for itself
a permanent home&mdash;a place of security for all the
valuable records of the nation. A spot for the
Government <em>alone</em>, called “<em>The Capitol of the
United States</em>,” near the center of population controlling
representation, free from private property.
A capital with capacious senatorial, representative
and judicial halls, contiguous to the
several departments, with state dwellings for senators
and representatives of the several states,
and other necessary buildings, all to be owned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
and controlled by the Government, each constructed
with reference to the intended uses,
large enough to accommodate an ordinary peaceable
assemblage of American citizens, with room
to spare.</p>

<p>The most celebrated speaker now living in
America, on reciting a visit to the present capital
during the sitting of Congress, states: “Another
thing that impressed me was, that the hall
of the House of Representatives was built in defiance
of all laws of acoustics. There are more
echoes than can be counted to play havoc with a
speech, and turn the finest oratory into a senseless
gabble.” A capital situated on the border
of an inland sea, with large grounds, parks,
lakes, lagoons, gardens, and fountains, in beauty
all that art and nature is able to make one
place on this continent fitly dedicated to the
keeping of the charter of the best government on
earth. And, then, if the crowned heads of the
world have a desire to see the majesty of a <em>Republic</em>,
owned and preserved by the people, let
them come and look upon “The Capital of the
United States”&mdash;where just laws are made and
interpreted alike for <em>all the people</em>.</p>

<p>A capital with the architectural requirements of
so great a nation, bristling with “peacemakers”
and a <em>floating</em> navy in sight, would increase
American pride and attachment, and do more to
advance the arts, sciences, and sound civilization
than all other national improvements combined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
It would “copy the Monroe Doctrine into international
law,” and secure peace over the entire
world.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
